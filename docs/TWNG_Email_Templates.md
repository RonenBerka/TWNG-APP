Hey [First Name],

You're in.

You just joined the TWNG waitlist — a community of guitar lovers who believe that every instrument has a story worth telling.

We're building something new: a place to document your guitars, share their stories, and connect with others who understand why a guitar is never just a guitar.

**What happens next?**
We're putting the finishing touches on TWNG. When we're ready to launch, you'll be among the first to know.

Until then, a question for you:

*What's the one guitar you wish you'd never let go?*

Reply to this email and tell us. We read every response.

Talk soon,

See what others are sharing. Find people who own the same model. Join the conversation.
