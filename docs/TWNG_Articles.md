## Article 1: Blackie — The Guitar That Sold for Nearly a Million Dollars

**Word count:** ~420

In 1970, Eric Clapton walked into a Nashville guitar shop called Sho-Bud and bought six vintage Stratocasters from the 1950s. He paid around $100 each.

He gave three away—one to George Harrison, one to Pete Townshend, one to Steve Winwood. From the remaining three, he built a single guitar using the best parts of each: a 1956 body with its black finish, a 1957 maple neck, and original mid-50s pickups.

He called it Blackie.

For the next 15 years, Blackie was Clapton's primary guitar. He played it at the Rainbow Concert in 1973. He played it at the ARMS Charity Concerts in 1983. He played it at Live Aid in 1985—one of the most watched concerts in history.

By 1985, the neck had worn dangerously thin. Clapton retired Blackie after a show in Hartford, Connecticut, ending one of the most documented guitar-and-player relationships in rock history.

Then, in 2004, Clapton put Blackie up for auction at Christie's in New York. The proceeds would go to Crossroads Centre, the drug and alcohol treatment facility he founded in Antigua.

The pre-sale estimate was $100,000 to $150,000.

Blackie sold for $959,500.

Guitar Center bought it. Today, the guitar sits in their flagship store on West 44th Street in New York City. It's been there for over 20 years now—a working-class guitar that became a piece of rock history, built from spare parts and played until it couldn't be played anymore.

In his autobiography, Clapton wrote: "It was hard. We had traveled a lot of miles together."

That's the thing about guitars. They're not just instruments. They're witnesses to our lives.

## Article 2: Why the 1959 Les Paul is Called "The Holy Grail"

**Word count:** ~430

Between 500 and 600 guitars. That's how many 1959 Gibson Les Paul Standards left the factory in Kalamazoo, Michigan that year. Blues guitarist Joe Bonamassa puts the number at 536 or 539.

They retailed for about $250.

Today, a 1959 Les Paul in good condition sells for $400,000 to $800,000. Celebrity-owned examples can exceed $1 million.

What happened?

First: the wood. Gibson used Honduran mahogany from trees that were centuries old—wood so different from today's plantation-grown mahogany that it might as well be a different species. The fretboards were solid Brazilian rosewood, now extremely rare and restricted. The maple tops were often quarter-sawn, producing the legendary "flame" patterns collectors obsess over.

Second: the pickups. The original PAF (Patent Applied For) humbuckers from 1959 have a balanced, singing tone that decades of aging have only improved. The magnets and coils have mellowed into something modern pickups can only approximate.

Third: the construction. The '59 had a long neck tenon—a joint design that increased wood-on-wood contact and gave the guitar its legendary sustain. Combined with the mahogany body and maple cap, it produced a warm, vocal-like midrange that defined rock and roll.

Fourth: the players. When the Les Paul was discontinued in 1960, it was considered a commercial failure. Then Eric Clapton used one on the "Beano" album. Then Mike Bloomfield. Then Peter Green, Jimmy Page, Keith Richards, Billy Gibbons.

A Marshall amp and a '59 Les Paul became the mother of all rock tones.

From Led Zeppelin to Fleetwood Mac to The Allman Brothers to Metallica—that sound is everywhere. And it all traces back to fewer than 600 guitars made in a single year.

The 1959 Les Paul represents a perfect storm: exceptional materials, thoughtful construction, historical timing, and the right players at the right moment. It's not just a guitar. It's a piece of sonic DNA embedded in six decades of music.

## Article 3: The Boat Paddle That Changed Everything

**Word count:** ~410

When Leo Fender unveiled his new guitar at the 1951 NAMM trade show, people laughed. They called it a "boat paddle." A "snow shovel."

They weren't entirely wrong. The Telecaster looked nothing like a guitar was supposed to look. No curves. No elegance. Just a flat slab of ash with a bolted-on maple neck. It looked like something you'd use to clear a driveway.

It was also the first mass-produced solid-body electric guitar in history.

The story starts in 1950, when Fender released the Esquire—a single-pickup prototype that mostly failed because the necks kept warping (no truss rod). Later that year, he released an improved two-pickup version called the Broadcaster.

Then Gretsch sent a cease-and-desist letter. They already had a drum kit called the "Broadkaster."

For a few months, Fender shipped guitars with no name at all—just a blank headstock. Collectors now call these "Nocasters," and they're worth a fortune.

By mid-1951, Fender had a new name: Telecaster. An homage to the television age. Price: $189.50.

The design was revolutionary in ways that weren't immediately obvious. The solid body could be die-cut instead of hand-carved, dramatically reducing costs. The bolt-on neck could be removed for repairs or replaced entirely. A truss rod inside the neck prevented warping. Everything was designed for mass production and easy maintenance.

And the sound? Bright, cutting, twangy—perfect for country music, which became its first home. Jimmy Bryant, the "fastest guitar in the country," made it famous. Later, it found its way into rock, punk, and everything in between.

Seventy-four years later, the Telecaster is still in continuous production. The basic design hasn't changed. Leo Fender got it right the first time.

Sometimes the boat paddle wins.

## Article 4: Trigger — The Guitar with a Hole in Its Heart

**Word count:** ~450

In 1969, Willie Nelson was playing a show at John T. Floore's Country Store in Helotes, Texas. He set his Baldwin acoustic guitar down on stage. A drunk stepped on it.

His bandmates took the crushed guitar to Nashville luthier Shot Jackson, hoping for a miracle. Jackson pronounced it dead on arrival—but offered Nelson a brand-new Martin N-20 classical guitar as a replacement.

Nelson bought it sight unseen for $750, with one condition: Jackson had to transplant the pickup from the dead Baldwin into the new Martin.

That guitar became Trigger.

The name came later—after Roy Rogers' horse. "Roy Rogers had a horse named Trigger," Nelson explains. "I figured, this is my horse."

Trigger is a Martin N-20 classical guitar, serial number 242830. The top is Sitka spruce from the Pacific Northwest. The back and sides are Brazilian rosewood. The fretboard is African ebony. The neck is Amazonian mahogany. The tuning pegs are German brass. All assembled in Nazareth, Pennsylvania.

Willie plays it with a pick, which is unusual for a nylon-string classical. Combined with the amplified pickup, it produces a Django Reinhardt-like tone—warm, jazzy, unmistakably Willie.

For over 55 years, Trigger has been on every album and at every show. That's more than 10,000 concerts and 85 studio albums. When the IRS came after Willie in the early '90s, he recorded an album called "The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?"—just him and Trigger, solo, to pay off his debt.

The guitar has a hole in it now. Years of picking in the same spot wore through the spruce top. Austin luthier Mark Erlewine maintains it twice a year and says the hole actually improves the sound.

Martin tried to make Willie a backup. They found another N-20 just three or four serial numbers away and modified it to match. Willie never really played it.

Other builders have tried too. None have worked. If Trigger can't play, Willie doesn't play. Band members come and go. Trigger is permanent.

When Willie's ranch in Bandera burned down, he ran in to save Trigger.

That's what a guitar becomes after 55 years. Not an instrument. Family.
