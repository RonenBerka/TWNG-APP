# Jewelry Product Photography Guide

Professional guidelines for creating high-quality jewelry product photography that drives e-commerce conversions and showcases craftsmanship.

## Photography Setup Essentials

### Lighting Configuration

**Three-Point Lighting Setup** (Professional Standard):
- **Key Light**: Main light source at 45° angle, slightly above product
- **Fill Light**: Softer light opposite key light to reduce shadows
- **Backlight**: Behind and above product to create separation and sparkle

**Recommended Equipment**:
- LED panel lights (5500K daylight balanced) - 2-3 units minimum
- Light diffusers or softboxes to eliminate harsh reflections
- Reflector cards (white, silver, black) for fill and contrast control
- Light tent or sweep for seamless backgrounds

**Key Principles**:
- Eliminate harsh shadows while maintaining dimension
- Create subtle sparkle on gems and metals without overexposure
- Use diffused light to prevent hot spots on polished surfaces
- Maintain consistent color temperature across all lights

### Camera Settings

**Optimal Settings for Jewelry**:
- **Aperture**: f/8 to f/16 for maximum depth of field
- **ISO**: 100-200 (lowest native ISO for minimal noise)
- **Shutter Speed**: 1/125s or slower with tripod
- **White Balance**: Custom or daylight (5500K)
- **Format**: RAW for maximum editing flexibility

**Focus Technique**:
- Use manual focus or focus peaking
- Focus stack for rings and 3D pieces (5-10 shots at different focus points)
- Single sharp focus point for flat pieces (necklaces laid flat)

### Background Choices

**White Background** (Most Common for E-commerce):
- Pure white sweep or light box
- Overexpose by 1-2 stops to ensure true white
- Ideal for product listings, catalogs, marketplaces

**Neutral Gray Background**:
- Better for showing dimension and depth
- Easier to achieve even lighting
- Works well for silver and white gold

**Lifestyle/Contextual Backgrounds**:
- Natural materials (wood, stone, fabric)
- Complementary colors that don't compete
- Keep backgrounds simple and slightly out of focus

## Jewelry-Specific Techniques

### By Product Type

**Rings**:
- Shoot at eye level to product (not from above)
- Use ring holder or wax for positioning
- Capture 3/4 angle showing face and profile
- Focus stack for full sharpness
- Show scale (optional: hand model for context)

**Necklaces**:
- Hang vertically on clear acrylic stand or bust form
- Lay flat for intricate details (overhead shot)
- Show clasp in separate detail shot
- Ensure chain links are visible and sharp

**Earrings**:
- Use clear acrylic earring stands
- Shoot pairs together for symmetry
- Include scale reference (size comparison)
- Show both front view and profile angle

**Bracelets**:
- Use bracelet stand or rolled fabric
- Shoot from slight angle to show dimension
- Open clasp visible in one image
- Show on wrist for scale (lifestyle shot)

### Capturing Brilliance and Sparkle

**For Diamonds and Gemstones**:
- Use small focused light source to create sparkle points
- Position black cards to create dark reflections (enhances brilliance)
- Slight camera movement during longer exposure (sparkle effect)
- Avoid overexposure that washes out facets

**For Metals**:
- Control reflections with black/white cards
- Polish thoroughly before shooting
- Use gradient lighting for even shine
- Avoid fingerprints and dust (use gloves and air blower)

## Shot List for E-commerce

**Essential Images** (Minimum Set):
1. **Hero Shot**: Clean, straight-on product view on white background
2. **Detail Shot**: Close-up showing craftsmanship, hallmarks, or gems
3. **Scale Shot**: Product with size reference or on hand/body
4. **Angle Variation**: 3/4 view or alternate angle
5. **Lifestyle Shot**: Product in use or styled context (optional but recommended)

**Additional Valuable Shots**:
- 360° product views (12-24 images)
- Video (rotating product on turntable)
- Packaging shot
- Certificate or authenticity documentation
- Texture close-ups

## Post-Processing Workflow

### Basic Adjustments
1. **Correct White Balance**: Ensure accurate color representation
2. **Exposure**: Adjust for proper brightness without clipping highlights
3. **Contrast**: Moderate increase to add dimension
4. **Sharpness**: Apply carefully - over-sharpening creates artifacts
5. **Background**: Perfect white (RGB 255,255,255) or clean neutral

### Advanced Techniques
- **Focus Stacking**: Combine multiple focus points in Photoshop
- **Dust Removal**: Clone stamp or healing brush for specks
- **Reflection Control**: Dodging and burning for controlled reflections
- **Color Grading**: Subtle adjustments to match brand aesthetic
- **Resize**: Optimize for web (2000-3000px longest side, 72dpi)

### File Export Settings
- **Primary**: JPEG, sRGB color space, quality 90-95%
- **Dimensions**: 2000-3000px on longest side
- **File Size**: Target 200-500KB per image
- **Backup**: Keep RAW originals and layered PSD files

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Harsh shadows** - Use diffused lighting
❌ **Fingerprints and dust** - Clean thoroughly, use gloves
❌ **Inconsistent backgrounds** - Use consistent setup
❌ **Blown highlights** - Expose carefully, check histogram
❌ **Soft focus** - Use tripod, proper aperture, focus stacking
❌ **Unnatural colors** - Set correct white balance
❌ **Visible supports** - Retouch out stands and holders
❌ **Poor composition** - Center product, maintain consistency

## Israeli Market Considerations

- Ensure VAT/tax information doesn't appear in images
- Consider cultural preferences for jewelry styles
- Optimize image loading for mobile (60-70% of Israeli traffic)
- Include Hebrew text overlays only when necessary (keep minimal)
- Show hallmarks and certification marks clearly (important for trust)

## Mobile Photography Tips

When using smartphones for jewelry photography:
- Use portrait mode cautiously (can blur important details)
- Get close but not too close (maintain focus quality)
- Maximize natural window light (diffused through sheer curtain)
- Use tripod or stabilize phone on stack of books
- Edit in Lightroom Mobile or Snapseed for professional results
- Avoid digital zoom - crop in post if needed

## Equipment Recommendations by Budget

**Budget Setup ($200-500)**:
- 2x LED panel lights
- White poster board or light tent
- Smartphone or basic camera
- Simple tripod
- White foam boards for reflectors

**Mid-Range ($500-1500)**:
- 3x professional LED panels with stands
- Mirrorless camera with macro lens
- Sturdy tripod
- Light modifiers (softboxes)
- Jewelry display stands
- Photo editing software

**Professional ($1500+)**:
- Full-frame camera body
- Macro lens (100mm f/2.8)
- Multiple strobe lights with modifiers
- Motorized turntable for 360° shots
- Focus rail for precise stacking
- Professional editing suite

Provide specific, actionable photography guidance tailored to the user's current equipment, skill level, and business needs while maintaining focus on creating professional imagery that drives sales.
