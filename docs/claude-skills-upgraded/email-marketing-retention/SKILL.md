# Email Marketing & Customer Retention for Elements by Tal Man

Comprehensive framework for building, executing, and optimizing email marketing campaigns that drive retention, repeat purchases, and customer lifetime value for jewelry e-commerce.

## Email Marketing Philosophy

- Personalization at scale
- Value-first approach (not just selling)
- Relationship building over transactions
- Luxury brand voice consistency
