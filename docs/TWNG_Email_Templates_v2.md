Hey [First Name],

Welcome to TWNG.

You just created a place for your guitars — their specs, their photos, their stories. All in one spot, just for you.

**Here's how to get started:**

**1. Add your first guitar**
It doesn't have to be rare or expensive. Just one that matters to you.

**2. Tell its story**
How did you get it? What does it mean? Write it down, or just speak it — we'll handle the rest.

**3. Keep it safe**
Your collection stays private. Share only if you want to, when you want to.

[Button: Add Your First Guitar]

That's it. Simple.

Welcome aboard.

Hey [First Name],

You just added your first guitar to TWNG:

**[Guitar Name/Model]**

It's saved. It's safe. And it's not going anywhere.

**What's next?**

A few ideas:

- **Add another** — Most collectors start with 2-3 guitars, then keep going
- **Fill in the story** — When did you get it? How? Why does it matter?
- **Try Magic Add** — Take a photo, let AI fill in the specs for you

Your collection is shaping up.
