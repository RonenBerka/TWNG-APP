# TWNG — Pricing Model

---

## Pricing Philosophy

**Core Principle:** Value first, monetization later.

1. **Free tier must be genuinely useful** — Not crippled
2. **Premium solves real problems** — Not artificial limits
3. **No paywall on core experience** — Keeping guitars is free
4. **Monetize power users** — Who get disproportionate value

---

**Price:** $0
**Target:** Everyone

### TWNG Pro
**Price:** $5/month or $48/year (20% discount)
**Target:** Serious collectors, professionals

### TWNG Collector (Future)

## Pricing Psychology

### Why $5/month?

- **Low enough** — Impulse decision for guitar people
- **High enough** — Filters non-serious users
- **Common price point** — Familiar (Spotify, etc.)
- **Annual discount** — Encourages commitment

### Why 20 guitars free?

- **Covers 80% of users** — Won't feel limited
- **Natural upgrade point** — Serious collectors have more
- **Generous feels good** — Builds trust
- **20 is a real number** — Not arbitrary

### Why limit Magic Add?

- **Costs us money** — AI API costs
- **Signals value** — "This is worth something"
- **Upgrade trigger** — Power users want more

### Phase 3: Full Pricing (Month 6+)
```
Free: Stable limits
Pro: $5/month (founding), $7/month (new users)
