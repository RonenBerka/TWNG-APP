# Ad Campaign Generator

Generate complete ad campaigns: copy, visuals, strategy, and optimization.

## Quick Start

For each ad request, deliver:
1. **Strategy brief** — Objective, audience, placement
2. **Ad copy** — Headlines, body, CTAs (multiple variations)
3. **Image prompts** — Ready for AI generation tools
4. **A/B testing plan** — What to test and why

## Ad Copy Framework

### Headlines (3-5 variations per ad)

| Type | Formula | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Benefit | [Result] + [Timeframe] | "Organize your guitar collection in 30 seconds" |
| Question | [Pain point]? | "Where do your guitar stories live?" |
| Statement | [Bold claim] | "Every guitar has a story" |
| How-to | How to [achieve result] | "How to never forget a guitar again" |
| Social proof | [Number] + [people] + [action] | "10,000 collectors trust TWNG" |

### Body Copy Formulas

**PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve)**
```
Problem: [State the pain]
Agitate: [Make it worse]
Solve: [Your solution]
```

**BAB (Before-After-Bridge)**
```
Before: [Current state]
After: [Desired state]
Bridge: [How to get there]
```

**AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)**
```
Attention: [Hook]
Interest: [Benefit]
Desire: [Proof/emotion]
Action: [CTA]
```

### CTA Variations

| Tone | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Direct | "Start Free", "Try Now", "Get Started" |
| Soft | "Learn More", "See How", "Explore" |
| Urgent | "Start Today", "Don't Wait", "Join Now" |
| Value | "Start Free — No Credit Card", "Free Forever" |

## AI Image Prompt Framework

### Prompt Structure

```
[Subject] + [Setting] + [Lighting] + [Mood] + [Style] + [Technical specs]
```

### Standard Elements

**Always include:**
- Aspect ratio (4:5 Instagram, 1:1 Facebook, 16:9 YouTube, 9:16 Stories)
- Style (photo-realistic, illustration, 3D render)
- Mood keywords (nostalgic, warm, professional, energetic)
- "No text" or "No logos" if needed

**MANDATORY — Guitar Accuracy (TWNG):**

Guitar collectors notice every detail. Inaccurate guitars destroy credibility. Always specify:

- **Inlays:** "Inlays at frets 3-5-7-9-12" (standard pattern)
- **Headstock:** Correct shape for brand (Fender 6-in-line, Gibson 3+3)
- **Body shape:** Exact model (Stratocaster double cutaway, Les Paul single cutaway)
- **Pickups:** Correct configuration (Strat: 3 single-coils, Les Paul: 2 humbuckers)
- **Bridge:** Correct type (Strat tremolo, Tune-o-matic, acoustic pin bridge)
- **Finish:** Accurate to model/era (sunburst, natural, solid colors)
- **Hardware:** Correct color (chrome, gold, nickel, black)

Example accuracy note in prompt:
```
"Fender Stratocaster with 6-in-line headstock, double cutaway body,
three single-coil pickups, synchronized tremolo bridge,
chrome hardware, inlays at frets 3-5-7-9-12"
```

**We are dealing with guitar memories — accuracy is non-negotiable.**
