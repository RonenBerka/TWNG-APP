## Every Guitar Has a Story. This Is Where You Tell It.

---

There's a guitar somewhere in your life.

Maybe it's leaning against your bedroom wall right now. Maybe it's in a case under your bed, waiting. Maybe it's hanging on the wall of a studio, a living room, a practice space you've called home for years.

Or maybe it's gone—sold to pay the bills, traded for something you needed more at the time, given to someone who needed it more than you did. Maybe it was stolen. Maybe you still think about it.

That guitar has a story. Every scratch, every dent, every worn fret. The songs you learned on it. The nights you stayed up playing when you should have been sleeping. The person who gave it to you, or the day you finally saved up enough to buy it yourself.

**TWNG is where those stories live.**

## Why We Built This

We noticed something strange.

People document everything these days. Their cars, their watches, their sneakers, their vinyl collections. But guitars? The instruments that were there for your first song, your first gig, your first heartbreak?

They end up forgotten in closets. Sold to strangers who don't know what they're getting. Lost to time without anyone remembering what they meant.

We thought that was wrong.

So we built a place to fix it.

## What TWNG Is

TWNG is a home for your guitars and their stories.

**Electric guitars.** The Strat you saved up for. The Les Paul you found at a pawn shop. The hollow-body your uncle left you.

**Acoustic guitars.** The Martin that's been in your family for three generations. The beat-up dreadnought you took backpacking through Europe. The 12-string you bought on a whim and never regretted.

**Classical guitars.** The nylon-string you learned on as a kid. The concert guitar your teacher helped you choose. The flamenco guitar you brought back from Spain.

**Bass guitars.** The Precision that anchored your first band. The Jazz Bass with the broken knob you never fixed. The fretless you're still trying to master.

If it has strings and it matters to you, it belongs here.

## What You Can Do Here

**Document what you have.** Photos, specs, serial numbers, the story of how you got it. Build a record that lasts.

**Remember what you had.** The guitars you've let go still have stories. Keep them alive.

**Share with people who get it.** Or keep it private. Your choice.

**Report stolen instruments.** If something happens, create a permanent record. Guitars have come home before. Documentation helps.

**Find guitars you've lost track of.** We're building toward reconnection—helping you find instruments you sold or traded years ago.

**Connect with others.** People who own the same model. People who understand why a guitar isn't just a tool. People who get it.

## What TWNG Is Not

We're not a marketplace. We're not here to buy and sell.

We're not a museum. We're not just for expensive vintage pieces.

We're not about value. We're about meaning.

A 1959 Les Paul is welcome here. So is a $99 acoustic with a crack down the back. If it matters to you, it matters.

## Who We Are

We're guitar people. We've carried instruments onto planes, into recording studios, across countries. We've sold guitars we shouldn't have sold. We've held onto guitars when it made no financial sense. We've spent hours online trying to find out where our old instruments ended up.

We built TWNG because we wanted it to exist.

Now it does.
