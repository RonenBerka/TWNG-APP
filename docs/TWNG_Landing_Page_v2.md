## Section 1: Hero

### Visual
Full-screen: Warm, intimate shot of a guitar in its case, or hands holding a beloved instrument. Nostalgic, personal feeling.

### Copy

**Main Headline:**
> Every Guitar Has a Story.

**Sub-headline:**
> Finally, a place to keep them.

**CTA Button:**
> Start — Free Forever

**Below CTA (small):**
> Your collection stays private. Always.

---

## Section 2: The Problem

### Headline:
> Where do your guitars live today?

### Body:
> In a spreadsheet? A folder of photos? Your memory?
>
> You know every scratch, every story, every moment with your guitars.
>
> But there's never been a proper place to keep all of it —
> the specs, the photos, the serial numbers, and the stories that make each one yours.
>
> Until now.

### Visual:
Scattered photos, a spreadsheet, a dusty guitar case — the "before" state.

---

## Section 3: The Solution

### Headline:
> A home for your guitars.

### Sub:
> Everything about your collection, in one beautiful place.

### Features (3 cards):

**1. Keep Their Stories**
> Every guitar has a history. Who owned it before you. How you found it. What it means. Now there's somewhere to put all of that.

**2. All the Details**
> Specs, serial numbers, photos from every angle. AI helps you capture it all in seconds — not hours.

**3. Safe and Private**
> Your collection is yours. Everything stays private unless you choose to share. No pressure. No public profiles by default.

---

## Section 4: How It Works

### Headline:
> Three steps. That's it.

### Steps:

**1. Add your guitar**
> Take a photo. Our AI identifies the model, year, and specs automatically.

**2. Tell its story**
> How did you get it? What does it mean to you? Write it or speak it — we'll take care of the rest.

**3. Keep it forever**
> Your guitar's record lives here. Safe, organized, and always accessible.

### Visual:
Simple illustrations or screenshots showing the Magic Add flow.

---

## Section 5: For Everyone

### Headline:
> For every guitar. Every player.

### Grid:

| Visual | Copy |
|--------|------|
| Electric | The Strat that started it all |
| Acoustic | The Martin that's been in your family for years |
| Classical | The nylon-string from your first lessons |
| Bass | The Precision that held down the low end |

### Closing:
> If it has strings and it matters to you — it belongs here.

---

## Section 6: Final CTA

### Headline:
> Your guitars are waiting.

### Sub:
> Start building your collection. It's free, it's private, and it takes less than a minute.

### CTA Button:

### Below:
> No credit card. No spam. Just a home for your guitars.
