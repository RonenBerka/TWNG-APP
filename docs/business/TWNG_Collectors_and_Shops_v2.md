## Part 1: Famous Guitar Collectors

---

### Joe Bonamassa — The Bona-seum

Joe Bonamassa doesn't just play the blues. He lives surrounded by it.

The son of a guitar dealer, Bonamassa grew up with the bug. Today, his Los Angeles home houses what he affectionately calls "The Bona-seum" — a personal museum of approximately **500 guitars and 500 amplifiers** (as of 2023).

His collection reads like a blues history book: Tommy Bolin's 1960 Les Paul, three original Flying Vs, a 1951 Fender Nocaster, and nearly a dozen "bursts" — those holy grail 1958–1960 Gibson Les Paul Standards that collectors dream about.

"People come to my house and they are overwhelmed," Bonamassa has said. "And it is overwhelming."

He conducts an annual clearout of about 5% of the collection, but somehow keeps adding more. The collection grows by 40–50 pieces a year.

### Kirk Hammett — The Horror Collection

Metallica's lead guitarist has spent decades building one of heavy metal's most distinctive guitar collections — instruments decorated with skulls, horror movie imagery, and custom artwork that reflects his love of classic horror films.

His most famous acquisition: "Greeny," the legendary 1959 Gibson Les Paul Standard once owned by Peter Green and Gary Moore. Hammett purchased it in 2014 for a reported **$2 million**.

In March 2025, Gibson Publishing released *The Collection: Kirk Hammett* — a 400-page coffee table book offering the deepest dive yet into his collection.

Later in 2025, Hammett announced he would auction off **more than 150 guitars and memorabilia** through Julien's Auctions, including the mystery Gibson SG he played at Ozzy Osbourne's final show.

The auction isn't a fire sale — it's a curated release from a collection large enough that 150 pieces represents just a fraction.

### Richard Gere — The Charitable Collection

In October 2011, Richard Gere did something unusual for a collector: he let go.

The actor auctioned 110 vintage guitars and amplifiers through Christie's New York, raising **$936,438** for Tibetan causes through his Gere Foundation.

The collection featured instruments by Martin, Gibson, Fender, Gretsch, and Epiphone — including guitars previously owned by Peter Tosh and Albert King.

The top lot was a 1960 Gibson Les Paul that sold for $98,500. Albert King's 1958 Flying V brought $74,500. A 1931 Martin D-28 sold for $62,500.

"I've had a love affair with guitars since I was a kid," Gere said before the sale. "They have been my true friends through the best and worst of times... Although it's more than a little painful to let them go, each one has been played, loved and appreciated, and will be again."

The sale was 96% sold by lot — proof that guitars with stories find new homes.

## Part 2: Legendary Guitar Shops

### Norman's Rare Guitars — Los Angeles (1975–2026)

For nearly 50 years, Norman's Rare Guitars at 18969 Ventura Blvd in the San Fernando Valley was a pilgrimage site. The walls were covered with vintage instruments that told the story of American music.

Norman Harris built the shop into a legend — and a Netflix documentary subject.

**On January 12, 2026**, Harris sold the shop to **TNAG Global**, the family-owned company behind Carter Vintage Guitars in Nashville. The acquisition includes more than 1,000 guitars currently in the shop, plus Harris's personal collection assembled over 50 years.

Harris, who faced health challenges including cancer and a heart attack, will remain actively involved in operations. The shop stays at its iconic location with its team intact.

Joe Bonamassa — one of Norman's best customers — gave his blessing: "I am extremely excited to see my Uncle Norm enter into this new chapter."

Beginning in the second half of 2026, Norman's will offer consignment through TNAG Global's authentication processes, with select inventory available online for the first time.

### Carter Vintage Guitars — Nashville (2012)

Located in the heart of Nashville's music scene, Carter Vintage Guitars opened in 2012 and quickly became a go-to for touring musicians and serious collectors.

**In 2022, TNAG Global acquired Carter Vintage**, bringing international reach while preserving the shop's identity. Since the acquisition, Carter Vintage has seen a **233% sales increase**.

Now, as the sister shop to Norman's Rare Guitars under TNAG ownership, Carter Vintage is part of a network connecting LA and Nashville — two cities central to American guitar history.

### Gruhn Guitars — Nashville (1970)

George Gruhn opened his shop on January 2, 1970, with 22 instruments in a small space next to the Ryman Auditorium's stage door. Hank Williams Jr. encouraged him to make the move to Nashville.

Today, Gruhn Guitars at 2120 8th Ave S (since 2013) is one of the world's premier destinations for vintage fretted instruments — guitars, basses, banjos, mandolins, and more.

Gruhn himself is considered one of the foremost experts on vintage American guitars. The shop buys, sells, consigns, trades, and appraises instruments, housing a museum-quality collection of classic Martin, Fender, Gibson, Gretsch, and National pieces.

**Hours:** Monday–Saturday, 10am–6pm

### Retrofret Vintage Guitars — Brooklyn (1983)

While Nashville has its country legends and LA has its rock history, Brooklyn's Retrofret has been serving the East Coast since 1983.

Located at 87 Luquer St in Carroll Gardens, Retrofret offers a private showroom experience with museum-quality restoration and repair on premises — considered the most complete lutherie shop on the East Coast.

They specialize in acoustic and electric guitars, basses, banjos, mandolins, ukuleles, effects pedals, and amps. Their Instagram following (**126K+ followers** as of 2025) reflects their reputation in the vintage community.

**Hours:** Monday–Friday 12pm–7pm, Saturday 12pm–6pm
*Note: Appointments required for repairs*
