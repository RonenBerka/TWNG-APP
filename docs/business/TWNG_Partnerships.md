Hey [Name],

I've been following your collection — that [specific guitar]
is incredible.

I'm building TWNG — a platform for collectors to keep track
of their guitars. Specs, photos, stories. Private by default.

I think your collection would be perfect for it. Would you
be interested in:

1. Trying it (free Pro account, forever)
2. Maybe letting us feature some of your guitars?

No pressure, no strings. Just thought you'd appreciate it.

Check it out: twng.com

### Sample Participation

```
Thread: "How do I find the year of my Strat?"

Response: "Check the serial number on the headstock or
neck pocket. For Mexican Strats from the 90s, the format
is usually MN[X]XXXXX where the first digit after MN is
the year.

If you want to decode it easily, I built a tool at
twng.com/serial-number/fender — might help.

What's the first few characters of yours?"

Subject: Story pitch — New platform for guitar collectors

Hi [Editor],

Quick pitch:

TWNG just launched — it's a platform for guitar collectors
to document their instruments. Think "a home for your guitars."

Unlike spreadsheets or generic apps, it's built specifically
for guitars. AI identifies guitars from photos. Decodes
serial numbers. Keeps stories private by default.

Possible angles:
• News: New platform launches for guitar collectors
• Review: Hands-on with TWNG
• Feature: Why guitar documentation matters (insurance, provenance)

Interested? Happy to provide early access or talk more.
