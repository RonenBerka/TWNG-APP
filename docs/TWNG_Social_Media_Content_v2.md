2. **Nostalgia** — First guitars, memories, "the one that got away"
3. **Education** — Guitar history, serial numbers, care tips

### Post 1: Announcement

**Visual:**
Warm, intimate shot of a guitar in soft light. Nostalgic feeling.

**Caption:**
```
Every guitar has a story.

The one you saved up for.
The one you inherited.
The one you wish you'd never let go.

Finally, there's a place to keep them.

TWNG is coming.

### Post 2: The Question

**Visual:**

**Caption:**
```
What's the one guitar you regret letting go?

We all have one.

The one you sold when times were tough.
The one you traded and still think about.
The one that got away.

Tell us in the comments. 👇

### Post 3: For Everyone (Carousel)

**Visual:**
4 slides — Electric, Acoustic, Classical, Bass — warm, beautiful photography.

**Caption:**
```
TWNG isn't just for one kind of player.

🎸 Electric — from your first Squier to your dream Les Paul
🪕 Acoustic — the Martin passed down through generations
🎻 Classical — the nylon-string from your first lessons
🎸 Bass — the Precision that held everything together

If it has strings and it matters to you — it belongs here.

### Post 4: Why We're Building This

**Visual:**
Candid shot of someone with their guitar. Real, not posed.

**Caption:**
```
Why are we building TWNG?

Because we've sold guitars we shouldn't have sold.

Because years later, we still wonder where they ended up.

Because a guitar isn't just an instrument — it's a memory. A milestone. A story.

And those stories deserve a home.

### Post 5: Nostalgia — First Guitar

**Visual:**
Vintage-style photo of a guitar, or an old photo of someone with their first guitar.

**Caption:**
```
Do you remember your first guitar?

The way it felt in your hands.
The first chord that actually sounded right.
The hours you spent in your room, figuring it out.

That guitar started something.

Now there's a place to keep that story.

### Post 8: How It Works (Carousel)

**Visual:**
5 slides showing the experience:

1. "How TWNG works"

4. "Tell its story" — story field
5. "Keep it forever" — collection view

**Caption:**
```
It takes 60 seconds.

1️⃣ Take a photo
2️⃣ AI identifies the guitar and fills in the specs
3️⃣ Add the story — or speak it, we'll transcribe
4️⃣ Done. Saved. Safe.

Your collection. Private by default.
