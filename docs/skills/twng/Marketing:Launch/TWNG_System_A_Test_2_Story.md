**The Telemaster That Saved a Tuesday**

*Sometimes the guitar you've wanted for years arrives exactly when you need it*

We've all had those days. The ones where nothing seems to go right, where you're just trying to get through. For @easombentley, one particularly rough Tuesday took an unexpected turn when a guitar arrived—not just any guitar, but the one they'd been dreaming about "for absolutely ages."

The instrument in question is a Telemaster, that beloved hybrid that combines Telecaster DNA with offset sensibilities. This particular example wears a stunning blue-green finish with the kind of honest wear that tells you it's been played, not just displayed. The Fender "Pat Pend" bridge plate visible in the video speaks to thoughtful construction.

But the specs aren't really the point here. What makes this guitar special is the timing—and the story.

"This has cheered me up on what has otherwise been a pretty miserable tuesday," the post reads. The guitar appeared as a deal "too good to pass up," and a supportive spouse (tagged with gratitude as "the best wife ever") made it possible.

This is what collecting is really about. Not just the instruments themselves, but the moments they mark. The searches that finally end. The people who understand why it matters. The bad days that become good ones because the right piece of wood and wire showed up at your door.

We'd love to know more about this Telemaster's journey to your hands. What was it about this particular guitar that ended the years-long search? @easombentley, your story has a home on TWNG whenever you're ready to tell it.

Subject: We featured your Telemaster story

Hey,

I came across your "New Guitar Day" post from a while back — the Telemaster that turned a rough Tuesday around. That story stuck with me.

"I've wanted something telecaster-ish for absolutely ages and then this thing came up at a deal that was too good to pass up."

We featured it on TWNG:
https://twng.com/articles/the-telemaster-that-saved-a-tuesday

We're building TWNG as the first platform specifically for guitar collectors to document and showcase their instruments — not just the specs, but the stories. Why this guitar? Why that day? Who helped make it happen?

Your Telemaster clearly has a story worth telling. You'd be able to:
• Claim your entry and add the full backstory
• Document the rest of your collection
• Connect with other players who get it

Interested? Just reply and I'll send you early access.

Best,
TWNG Team

P.S. — Please thank @bakerycottage for us. Supportive partners who understand the guitar thing are rare.

## Comparison: Test #1 vs Test #2

| Metric | Test #1 (@djlavalamp) | Test #2 (@easombentley) |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Guitar Interest** | 9/10 (1954 Les Paul) | 6/10 (Telemaster) |
| **Story Quality** | 7/10 (aesthetic focus) | 9/10 (rich narrative) |
| **Overall Score** | 8/10 | 8/10 |
| **Article Angle** | Collection showcase | Personal moment |
| **Outreach Hook** | "Your '54 Les Paul" | "Your story resonated" |

### Key Insight

Both posts scored 8/10 overall but for different reasons:
- **Test #1** had exceptional guitar interest (vintage, rare) with moderate story
- **Test #2** had moderate guitar interest but exceptional story

**This validates the scoring system** — it correctly identifies feature-worthy posts whether they're gear-focused OR story-focused, which aligns with TWNG's "Every Guitar Has a Story" positioning.
