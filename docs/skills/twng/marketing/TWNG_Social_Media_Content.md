### Post 1: Announcement

**Visual:**

**Caption (Instagram/Facebook):**
```
Every guitar has a story.

The one you saved up for.
The one you inherited.
The one you wish you'd never sold.

We're building a place for those stories.

TWNG is coming soon.

### Post 2: The Question

**Visual:**

**Caption:**
```
What's the one guitar you regret letting go?

We all have one.

The one we sold when money was tight.
The one we traded and still think about.
The one that got away.

Tell us in the comments. 👇

### Post 3: For Everyone

**Visual:**
Carousel (4 images): Electric, Acoustic, Classical, Bass — each beautifully photographed.

**Caption:**
```
TWNG isn't just for one kind of guitar.

🎸 Electric — from your first Squier to your dream Les Paul
🪕 Acoustic — the Martin that's been in your family for generations
🎻 Classical — the nylon-string you learned on as a kid
🎸 Bass — the Precision that anchored your first band

If it has strings and it matters to you, it belongs here.

Coming soon. Link in bio.

### Post 4: Why We're Building This

**Visual:**
Founders with guitars, or a candid shot of someone playing. Authentic, not posed.

**Caption:**
```
Why are we building TWNG?

Because we've sold guitars we shouldn't have sold.

Because we've spent hours trying to find where our old instruments ended up.

Because guitars aren't just things — they're memories, milestones, and stories.

And those stories deserve a home.

"Blackie" — Eric Clapton's Frankenstein Stratocaster.

Built from the best parts of six 1950s Strats.
Played on "Cocaine," "Wonderful Tonight," "Lay Down Sally."
Auctioned for $959,500 in 2004 — still a record for a Stratocaster.

Every guitar has a story. This is one of thousands.

We're building a place for yours too.

### Educational Posts:

```
Did you know?

The serial number on your guitar can tell you:
📅 When it was made
🏭 Where it was made
🔢 Its place in the production run

TWNG helps you document all of this — and keep it safe.

#GuitarFacts #TWNG
```

```
How to photograph your guitar for your TWNG collection:

📸 Natural light (near a window)
📐 Multiple angles (front, back, headstock, any unique features)
🔍 Close-ups of wear marks, scratches, mods — they tell the story
📏 Include serial number shots for documentation

Your guitars deserve good photos.
