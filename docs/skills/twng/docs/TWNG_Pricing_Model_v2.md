2. **Privacy = User choice** — You decide who sees what
3. **Monetize services, not storage** — Premium features, not artificial limits
4. **Build community first** — Revenue follows value

## Privacy Model: User Choice

> **"Your guitars. Your way."**

Each guitar has its own visibility setting:

| Setting | Who Can See | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Private** | Only you | Valuable guitars, personal archive, insurance docs |
| **Link** | Anyone with the link | Share with friends, get help identifying |
| **Public** | Anyone (searchable) | Community, show collection, connect with others |

### Privacy Defaults
- **Default:** Private (nothing shared without explicit choice)
- **Change anytime:** Toggle visibility per guitar
- **Mix and match:** Some private, some public

### Why User Choice?

1. **Respects collectors** — Many want privacy for security reasons
2. **Enables community** — Those who want to share, can
3. **No pressure** — Never forced to share anything
4. **Flexibility** — Needs change, settings change

## Future Premium Services (Not Limits)

When we introduce paid features, they'll be **genuine value-adds**, not restrictions on free users.

### Potential Premium Services (Future)

| Service | Value | Target |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Insurance Reports** | Professional documentation | Collectors with valuable instruments |
| **Collection Export** | PDF, CSV, custom formats | Archive needs |
| **Valuation Tools** | Market estimates, trends | Serious collectors |
| **API Access** | Integration with other tools | Dealers, developers |
| **Advanced Analytics** | Collection insights, gaps | Data-oriented users |
| **Print Products** | Collection books, posters | Keepsake creation |
| **Appraisal Services** | Professional valuations | Sales, insurance |

**Key principle:** Free users never lose what they have. Premium adds capabilities, doesn't remove them.

## FAQ Updates (Pricing)

### Is TWNG free?
**Yes. Completely free.** Add unlimited guitars. No catch. No credit card. No trial that expires.

### Wait, unlimited guitars for free?
Yes. Upload as many guitars as you want. 5 guitars, 50 guitars, 500 guitars — all free, forever.

### How does TWNG make money then?
We're focused on building something useful first. In the future, we may offer premium services (advanced features, integrations, professional tools) — but **keeping your guitars will always be free.**

### Will you add limits later?
No. We believe your guitar collection shouldn't have a paywall. Future premium features will be add-ons, not restrictions on what you already have.

### Is there a Pro version?
Not yet. When we introduce premium features, they'll be genuinely useful extras — not artificial limits on free users.

## One Last Thing

**Why give everything away for free?**

Because the real value isn't in charging people to store guitars.

It's in building the place where guitar people come together — to keep, to share, to discover, to connect.

When that community exists, the revenue opportunities follow naturally.

**First: Build something people love.**
**Then: Find sustainable ways to grow.**
