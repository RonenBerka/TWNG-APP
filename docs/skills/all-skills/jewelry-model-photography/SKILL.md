## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Preparation

**A. Source Images Needed**:

**Model Photos**:
- High resolution (minimum 2000x2000px)
- Good lighting (natural or studio)
- Clean background (white, neutral, or contextual)
- Model in appropriate pose for jewelry type
- Sharp focus, no motion blur

**Where to Find Model Photos**:
```
Free Stock:
• Unsplash.com (commercial use)
• Pexels.com (commercial use)
• Pixabay.com (commercial use)
Search: "woman portrait jewelry" "model neck" "hand jewelry pose"

Paid Stock:
• Shutterstock.com ($29-199/month)
• Adobe Stock (10 images/$29.99)
• iStock by Getty Images
Better quality, more variety

Custom Photoshoot:
• Hire local model ($50-200/hour)
• Studio rental ($50-150/hour)
• Or use friends/family (free!)
```

**Jewelry Photos**:
- Isolated on white/transparent background
- High resolution (2000x2000px+)
- Multiple angles available
- Proper lighting (no harsh shadows)
- Sharp, in-focus details

**B. Lighting Analysis**:

Before starting, analyze your model photo:
```
✓ Direction of light (front, side, top?)
✓ Light temperature (warm, cool, neutral?)
✓ Shadow hardness (soft or hard edges?)
✓ Skin tone and color cast
✓ Background brightness
```

This will guide jewelry placement and shadow creation.

### Phase 2: Jewelry Preparation

**Using Remove.bg (Free Method)**:

```
1. Go to remove.bg
2. Upload your jewelry photo
3. Download PNG with transparent background
4. Open in Photopea (free Photoshop alternative)
5. Clean up any rough edges:
   - Use Eraser tool for precision
   - Refine edges with Select > Refine Edge
6. Save as high-quality PNG
```

**Manual Background Removal (Photoshop/Photopea)**:

```
1. Open jewelry image
2. Select > Subject (AI selection)
   OR
   Use Pen Tool for perfect edges (P key)
3. Layer > Layer Mask > Reveal Selection
4. Refine mask edges:
   Select mask > Properties > Refine Edge
   - Smooth: 2-3
   - Feather: 0.5px
   - Contrast: 10-20%
5. Export as PNG with transparency
```

### Phase 3: Placement & Scaling

**Critical: Getting Size Right**

**For Necklaces**:
```
Measurement Reference:
• Average necklace: 16-18 inches (40-45cm)
• From collarbone to pendant: ~10-15cm
• Pendant size: typically 1.5-3cm

In Photoshop/Photopea:
1. Place jewelry layer on model
2. Free Transform (Ctrl/Cmd + T)
3. Hold Shift while scaling (maintains proportion)
4. Reference: Pendant should be proportional to neck width
   - Too small = looks cheap
   - Too large = looks fake
5. Position at natural hang point (collarbone area)
```

**For Earrings**:
```
Measurement Reference:
• Drop earrings: 2-7cm length
• Studs: 0.5-1.5cm diameter
• From earlobe to bottom: varies by style

Placement:
1. Identify earlobe position
2. Scale earring to realistic size
3. Rotation: Should hang naturally (slight angle)
4. For studs: Center on earlobe
5. For drops: Slight forward tilt (gravity effect)
```

**For Rings**:
```
Measurement Reference:
• Ring width: typically 2-8mm
• Finger width reference: ~15-20mm

Placement:
1. Follow finger's natural curve
2. Use Warp Tool (Edit > Transform > Warp)
3. Bend ring to match finger contour
4. Ensure perspective matches hand angle
```

**For Bracelets**:
```
Measurement Reference:
• Bracelet: typically 17-19cm circumference
• Should have slight gap (not tight)

Placement:
1. Position on wrist area
2. Use Warp to create natural curve
3. Add slight gap between bracelet and skin
4. Consider wrist angle/perspective
```

### Phase 4: Lighting & Color Matching

**A. Match Jewelry to Model Lighting**:

```
In Photoshop/Photopea:

1. Create Adjustment Layers for jewelry:
   Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Curves
   Clip to jewelry layer (Alt + click between layers)

2. Match overall brightness:
   - If model is bright: lift curves
   - If model is darker: lower curves
   - Use histogram as guide

3. Match color temperature:
   Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Color Balance
   - If model has warm tones: add yellow/red
   - If model has cool tones: add blue/cyan
   - Match skin tone warmth

4. Match saturation:
   Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Hue/Saturation
   - Lower if model photo is muted
   - Increase if model photo is vibrant
   - Gold should still look like gold!
```

**B. Add Realistic Shadows**:

**Soft Shadow Method** (Most Natural):
```
1. Duplicate jewelry layer
2. Move duplicate below original
3. Fill with dark gray/black (Edit > Fill > Black)
4. Transform to match light direction:
   - Light from left = shadow on right
   - Light from above = shadow below
5. Blur shadow:
   Filter > Blur > Gaussian Blur (15-30px)
6. Adjust opacity: 20-40% (soft shadows)
7. Use Layer Mask to fade shadow edges
8. Add slight warp/distortion to follow body contours
```

**Contact Shadow** (Where Jewelry Touches Skin):
```
1. Create new layer below jewelry
2. Use soft brush (0% hardness)
3. Paint dark shadow where jewelry contacts skin
4. Very small area (2-3mm wide)
5. Opacity: 40-60%
6. Blur slightly (2-3px)
7. This adds critical depth!
```

**Hard Shadow Method** (Direct Light):
```
For harder light sources:
1. Same as soft shadow
2. BUT: Less blur (5-10px)
3. Higher opacity (50-70%)
4. Sharper edges
5. More defined shadow shape
```

### Phase 5: Reflections & Highlights

**Adding Skin Reflections to Jewelry**:

```
For Gold/Silver jewelry:

1. Sample skin color from model:
   - Eyedropper tool (I key)
   - Click on nearby skin

2. Create new layer above jewelry
3. Set blend mode: Overlay or Soft Light
4. Paint with soft brush on jewelry highlights
5. Very subtle! Opacity: 10-20%
6. This makes jewelry "belong" in the scene

Critical areas to add reflections:
• Where jewelry curves toward skin
• Under pendants (neck reflection)
• Inside rings (finger reflection)
```

**Adding Environmental Reflections**:

```
If model is in environment (not white bg):

1. Sample colors from background
2. Add subtle hints to jewelry reflections
3. Sky = blue tints on top edges
4. Warm interior = golden reflections
5. Use very low opacity (5-15%)
```

### Phase 6: Final Refinement

**A. Edge Refinement**:

```
Zoom to 200-300%:

1. Check all edges of jewelry
2. Use small eraser (soft, 1-2px) to soften hard edges
3. Add slight glow where metal catches light:
   - New layer, white brush
   - 10% opacity
   - Paint on light-catching edges

4. Blur edges slightly if too sharp:
   - Select jewelry layer
   - Filter > Blur > Gaussian Blur (0.5-1px)
   - Makes it match photo grain
```

**B. Color Grading the Complete Image**:

```
After jewelry is placed:

1. Flatten image (or group all layers)
2. Add final color grade:
   - Curves adjustment (slight S-curve)
   - Vibrance (+5 to +15)
   - Slight sharpening

3. Match e-commerce style:
   - Bright and clear for product pages
   - Moody for lifestyle shots
   - Clean and minimal for luxury brands
```

**C. Quality Check Checklist**:

```
Before exporting, verify:
□ Jewelry scale looks realistic
□ Shadows fall in correct direction
□ Shadow softness matches scene
□ Contact shadows present
□ Colors harmonize with skin/scene
□ No visible edge halos
□ Jewelry follows body contours
□ Reflections look natural
□ Overall image looks cohesive
□ No obvious "Photoshop look"
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Technique 1: Chain/Necklace Warping

Chains are tricky because they need to:
- Follow neck contour
- Show realistic drape
- Not look stiff

**Method**:
```
1. Place chain on model
2. Edit > Transform > Warp
3. Drag control points to follow neck curve
4. Add slight sag in middle (gravity)
5. Ensure clasp area goes behind neck
6. Use Liquify filter for fine adjustments:
   Filter > Liquify > Forward Warp Tool
7. Pay special attention to collarbone area
```

### Technique 2: Multiple Jewelry Pieces

When adding multiple pieces (e.g., necklace + earrings):

```
Order of Operations:
1. Place all pieces first (rough position)
2. Scale each piece independently
3. Create shadows for each piece
4. Ensure no shadow overlaps
5. Add interaction shadows:
   - Where pieces might cast shadows on each other
   - Earring shadow on neck if close
   - Necklace shadow on chest

Consistency:
✓ Same light direction for all pieces
✓ Same shadow softness
✓ Same color grading
✓ Same level of realism
```

### Technique 3: Matching Different Metal Colors

**Gold on Different Skin Tones**:
```
Light skin:
• Gold appears more yellow-orange
• Higher contrast
• Brighter highlights

Medium skin:
• Gold appears warm and rich
• Moderate contrast
• Balanced highlights

Dark skin:
• Gold appears more intense/saturated
• Beautiful contrast
• Pronounced highlights

Adjustment:
Use Curves/Color Balance to match gold warmth to skin undertones
```

### Technique 4: Creating Motion Blur

For lifestyle shots with movement:

```
1. Place jewelry on model
2. Duplicate jewelry layer
3. Bottom layer: Motion Blur
   Filter > Blur > Motion Blur
   - Angle: Direction of movement
   - Distance: 10-20px
4. Top layer: Keep sharp
5. Adjust opacity to blend (60-80% for motion layer)
6. Adds dynamic feeling!
```

## AI-Assisted Workflows

### Using Photoshop Generative Fill

```

   "delicate gold necklace with pendant"
4. Generate 3 variations
5. Choose best result
6. Refine with manual tools

Pros: Very fast, understands context
Cons: Less control, may not match exact product
```

### Using Midjourney for Concept Visualization

```
Prompt Structure:
"product photography, [jewelry type] on model,
professional lighting, white background,
elegant [style], high-end jewelry,
ultra detailed, photorealistic --ar 3:4 --style raw"

Example:
"product photography, gold necklace with diamond pendant
on female model, professional lighting, white background,
elegant minimalist design, high-end jewelry,
ultra detailed, photorealistic --ar 3:4 --style raw"

Best for: Inspiration, concept art
NOT for: Exact product representation
```

```

## Common Mistakes & Fixes

### Mistake 1: Wrong Scale

**Problem**: Jewelry too big or too small
**Fix**:
```
Use these real-world references:
• Pendant: typically 1.5-3cm
• Ring width: 2-8mm
• Earring drops: 2-7cm
• Chain thickness: 1-3mm

Always keep a ruler visible in reference images
```

### Mistake 2: Floating Jewelry

**Problem**: Jewelry doesn't touch skin, looks disconnected
**Fix**:
```
Add contact shadows!
• Dark shadow exactly where jewelry touches
• Use very soft brush
• Small area (2-3mm)
• Essential for realism
```

### Mistake 3: Wrong Light Direction

**Problem**: Shadow falls opposite to scene lighting
**Fix**:
```
Before adding jewelry:
1. Analyze light direction in model photo
2. Draw imaginary line from light source
3. Shadows should fall along this line
4. Check model's own shadows for reference
```

### Mistake 4: Over-Sharpening

**Problem**: Jewelry looks "cut out" and pasted
**Fix**:
```
Match the image grain:
1. Check model photo sharpness level
2. Apply slight blur to jewelry (0.5-1px)
3. Add subtle noise if model photo has grain:
   Filter > Noise > Add Noise (1-2%)
```

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Perspective

**Problem**: Flat jewelry on angled surface
**Fix**:
```
Use Transform tools:
1. Edit > Transform > Perspective
2. Distort jewelry to match body angle
3. For rings: Must follow finger curve
4. For bracelets: Must curve around wrist
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: Shadows Look Fake

```
Symptoms:
• Too dark, too sharp, or wrong direction
• All same softness regardless of distance

Solutions:
1. Analyze reference shadows in original photo
2. Match softness (closer = softer, further = sharper)
3. Reduce opacity (start at 20%, adjust up)
4. Add multiple shadow layers:
   - Ambient shadow (very soft, light)
   - Contact shadow (sharp, dark)
   - Cast shadow (medium soft)
```

### Problem: Colors Don't Match

```
Symptoms:
• Jewelry looks too bright/dark
• Wrong color temperature
• Doesn't fit the scene

Solutions:
1. Create Curves adjustment layer
2. Clip to jewelry layer (Alt+click between layers)
3. Match brightness to surrounding area
4. Use Color Balance to match warmth
5. Check in grayscale - values should match
```

### Problem: Edges Look Cut Out

```
Symptoms:
• Hard edge line visible
• "Pasted on" appearance
• Halos around jewelry

Solutions:
1. Refine mask edges:
   Properties > Refine Edge > Feather 0.5px
2. Add slight blur (0.5px)
3. Use small eraser on edges (10% opacity)
4. Match image grain with Add Noise filter
5. Ensure lighting matches at edges
```

### Problem: Jewelry Looks Flat

```
Symptoms:
• No depth or dimension
• Doesn't pop from background

Solutions:
