## Brand Voice Framework

### 1. Voice Attributes Matrix

Define your brand's core voice attributes (choose 3-5):

| Attribute | We Are | We Are Not | Example |
|-----------|--------|------------|---------|
| **Friendly** | Warm, approachable | Overly casual, sloppy | "We're here to help" vs "Hey dude!" |
| **Professional** | Expert, reliable | Cold, corporate | "Our expertise..." vs "Per our policy..." |
| **Innovative** | Forward-thinking | Jargon-heavy | "New approach" vs "Synergize solutions" |
| **Authentic** | Genuine, honest | Fake, salesy | "Here's what we found" vs "AMAZING DEAL!" |
| **Empowering** | Supportive, enabling | Preachy, condescending | "You can do this" vs "You should..." |

### 2. Tone Adaptation Guide

Tone shifts based on context while voice stays consistent:

| Context | Tone Shift | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Celebration** | Enthusiastic, warm | "We're thrilled to announce..." |
| **Apology** | Sincere, humble | "We understand this affected you..." |
| **Education** | Clear, patient | "Here's how it works..." |
| **Urgency** | Direct, focused | "Action needed: ..." |
| **Support** | Empathetic, helpful | "We hear you. Let's solve this..." |
| **Sales** | Confident, value-focused | "Transform your [X] with..." |

| Contractions | Yes | "We're" not "We are" |
| Numbers | Spell 1-9, digits 10+ | "five items" vs "15 items" |
| Dates | Month DD, YYYY | January 15, 2026 |
| Times | 12-hour with AM/PM | 9:00 AM |
| Currency | Symbol before | ₪150, $50 |

#### Capitalization Rules

| Product names | As trademarked | iPhone, LinkedIn |
| Job titles | Lowercase unless before name | "the CEO" vs "CEO John Smith" |

#### Punctuation
