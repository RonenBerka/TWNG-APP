## Messaging Framework

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
```
TWNG is the first platform dedicated to documenting guitar history.
Think of it as a digital passport for your guitar - tracking every
owner, repair, and modification. We're building a community where
collectors, players, and luthiers connect around the stories their
instruments tell.
```

### Hebrew Version
```
TWNG היא הפלטפורמה הראשונה שמוקדשת לתיעוד היסטוריית גיטרות.
חשוב על זה כמו דרכון דיגיטלי לגיטרה - שעוקב אחרי כל בעלים,
תיקון ושינוי. אנחנו בונים קהילה שבה אספנים, נגנים ולות'יירס
מתחברים סביב הסיפורים שהכלים שלהם מספרים.
```

### Taglines by Context

| Context | Tagline |
|---------|---------|
| General | Every guitar has a past. Make sure it has a future. |
| Collectors | Your collection deserves better than a spreadsheet. |
| Players | Know your instrument's story. |
| Luthiers | Your work speaks. Now it stays. |
| Hebrew | לכל גיטרה יש סיפור. ספר את שלה. |
