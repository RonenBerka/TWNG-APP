### Jimmy Page — The 1,500-Guitar Legend

Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page reportedly owns **over 1,500 guitars** (as of 2005).

His most famous instruments include "Number One" — a 1959 Gibson Les Paul Standard he bought from Joe Walsh in 1969 — and the legendary "Dragon" Telecaster, given to him by Jeff Beck in 1966. That Telecaster was used to record the solo on "Stairway to Heaven."

His 1971 Gibson EDS-1275 double-neck became iconic for performing "Stairway to Heaven" live.

**Notable fact:** Page has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice — once with The Yardbirds and once with Led Zeppelin.
