## Section 1: Hero

### Background
Full-screen image or video: Close-up of hands on guitar neck, warm lighting, vintage feel. Could also be a wall of guitars or an open guitar case.

### Copy

**Pre-headline (small, above main headline):**
> Coming Soon

**Main Headline:**
> Every Guitar Has a Story.
> This Is Where You Tell It.

**Subheadline:**
> TWNG is a new home for guitar lovers — a place to document your instruments, share their stories, and connect with others who understand why a guitar is never just a guitar.

**CTA Section:**
> Be the first to know when we launch.

**Email Input:**
- Placeholder: "Enter your email"
- Button: "Join the Waitlist"

**Below CTA (small text):**
> No spam. Just guitars.

---

## Section 2: The Problem

### Headline:
> Your Guitars Deserve More Than a Closet

### Body Copy:
> People document everything today — their cars, their watches, their sneakers.
>
> But guitars? The instruments that were there for your first song, your first gig, your first heartbreak?
>
> They end up forgotten. Sold to strangers who don't know what they're getting. Lost without anyone remembering what they meant.
>
> We think that's wrong.

### Visual:
Split image: Left side — dusty guitar in closet. Right side — guitar being played, warm lighting.

---

## Section 3: The Solution

### Headline:
> A Home for Your Guitars and Their Stories

### Features (3-4 cards or icons):

**1. Document**
> Build a record of every instrument you own — or have ever owned. Photos, specs, serial numbers, and the story of how you got it.

**2. Remember**
> The guitars you've let go still have stories. Keep their memory alive.

**3. Connect**
> Find others who own the same model. Share tips. Trade stories. Meet people who get it.

**4. Protect**
> If something happens, you'll have a permanent record. Stolen guitars have come home before. Documentation helps.

---

## Section 4: Social Proof / Credibility

### Option A — Stats (if available):
> **[X]** guitarists already on the waitlist
> **[X]** countries represented
> **[X]** stories waiting to be told

### Option B — Quote:
> "Finally, a place that treats guitars the way we feel about them."
> — *Early tester*

### Option C — Founder's Note:
> **From the founders:**
> "We built TWNG because we wanted it to exist. We've sold guitars we shouldn't have sold. We've spent hours trying to find where our old instruments ended up. We know you have too."

---

## Section 5: For Everyone

### Headline:
> For Every Guitar. Every Player. Every Story.

### Body:
> TWNG isn't just for one type of guitarist.

### Visual Grid (4 items):

| Image | Label |
|-------|-------|
| Electric guitar | **Electric** — From your first Squier to your dream Les Paul |
| Acoustic guitar | **Acoustic** — The Martin in your family for three generations |
| Classical guitar | **Classical** — The nylon-string you learned on as a kid |
| Bass guitar | **Bass** — The Precision that anchored your first band |

### Closing line:
> If it has strings and it matters to you, it belongs here.

---

## Section 6: Final CTA

### Headline:
> Ready to Tell Your Story?

### Subheadline:
> Join the waitlist and be among the first to create your collection.

### Email Signup:

## Design Notes

### Color Palette Suggestions:
- Primary: Warm amber/gold (like aged wood)
- Secondary: Deep brown or charcoal
- Accent: Cream/off-white
- Text: Dark gray on light, cream on dark

### Typography:
- Headlines: Serif or display font (warmth, heritage)
- Body: Clean sans-serif (readability)

### Imagery Style:
- Warm, natural lighting
- Close-ups of guitar details (frets, headstocks, wear marks)
- Hands on instruments
- Avoid stock photo feel — authentic, lived-in

### Mobile Considerations:
- Hero CTA visible without scrolling
- Single-column layout
- Large tap targets for email input
- Features stack vertically
