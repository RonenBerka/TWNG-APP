### Pickup Specifications Guide

**Key Pickup Specs to Document:**

| Spec | What It Means | Impact on Tone |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| **DC Resistance (kΩ)** | Coil wire resistance | Higher = hotter output |
| **Inductance (H)** | Magnetic field strength | Affects resonance peak |
| **Magnet Type** | AlNiCo II/III/V, Ceramic | AlNiCo=warmer, Ceramic=brighter |
| **Output (mV)** | Signal strength | Higher = more drive |
| **Resonant Peak (kHz)** | Frequency emphasis | Higher=brighter, Lower=warmer |

**Magnet Types Quick Reference:**
- **AlNiCo II**: Warm, vintage, lower output (PAF-style)
- **AlNiCo III**: Weakest, very warm, clean
- **AlNiCo V**: Brighter, tighter, higher output
- **AlNiCo VIII**: Very strong, tight bass
- **Ceramic**: Bright, aggressive, high output

**Note**: Resonance curves (frequency response graphs) provide better tonal comparison than DC resistance alone. DC resistance is easy to measure but doesn't tell the whole story.

### Wood Types (Tonewoods)

**Body Woods:**
| Wood | Tone | Weight | Common On |
|------|------|--------|-----------|
| Alder | Balanced, full | Medium | Fender |
| Ash | Bright, snappy | Medium-Heavy | Fender, 50s spec |
| Swamp Ash | Bright, resonant | Light | Tele, Premium Strats |
| Mahogany | Warm, thick | Heavy | Gibson |
| Maple | Bright, sustain | Heavy | Often as top |
| Basswood | Neutral, balanced | Light | Ibanez, budget guitars |
| Korina | Warm, clear | Medium | Flying V, Explorer |
| Poplar | Neutral | Light | Budget guitars |

**Neck Woods:**
| Wood | Tone | Feel |
|------|------|------|
| Maple | Bright, snappy | Hard, smooth |
| Mahogany | Warm | Softer |
| Roasted Maple | Stable, bright | Hard |

**Fretboard Woods:**
| Wood | Tone | Maintenance | Look |
|------|------|-------------|------|
| Maple | Bright | Finish protects | Light, shows wear |
| Rosewood | Warm | Oil occasionally | Dark brown |
| Ebony | Bright, fast | Oil occasionally | Black |
| Pau Ferro | Rosewood-like | Oil occasionally | Varied brown |
| Richlite | Consistent | None | Composite, dark |
| Laurel | Rosewood-like | Oil occasionally | Budget alternative |

## 🔢 Serial Number Decoding

### General Tips
- Serial numbers can appear on: headstock, neck plate, heel, inside body
- Same number format may have been used across years
- Always cross-reference with other dating methods
- Serial numbers are ONE piece of the puzzle - verify with other evidence

### 🔍 Additional Authentication Methods
Beyond serial numbers, use these to verify date/authenticity:

| Method | Location | What It Reveals |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **Potentiometer Codes** | Inside electronics cavity | Week/year of pot manufacture |
| **Neck Date Stamps** | Neck heel or pocket | Date neck was made |
| **Capacitor Codes** | Electronics cavity | Era of components |
| **Pickup Stamps** | Bottom of pickups | Production date |
| **Body Stamps** | Inside body cavity | Production info |
| **Tuner Stamps** | Underside of tuners | Manufacturer/date |

**Pot Code Reading (CTS format):**
- Format: 137-XXYY (137 = CTS)
- XX = Year (2 digits), YY = Week
- Example: 137-8934 = 34th week of 1989

**Japanese Emperor Dating Codes:**
Some Japanese guitars (Alvarez-Yairi, others) use traditional Japanese calendar:
- **Showa Era** (1970-1988): Codes 45-63 = years 1970-1988
- **Heisei Era** (1989-2000): Codes 1-12 = years 1989-2000
- Example: First two digits "52" = 1977 (Showa 52)
