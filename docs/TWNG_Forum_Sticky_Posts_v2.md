## 💬 General Discussion

**Title:** Welcome to the Conversation

**Post:**

Hey,

We built TWNG because we believe every guitar has a story worth telling.

This is the place to talk about anything and everything guitar-related. Your latest obsession. A song you can't stop playing. A memory from your first gig. Whatever's on your mind.

**A few ground rules:**

1. **Be kind.** We're all here because we love the same thing.
2. **No selling.** Market Talk is the place for that.
3. **Stay on topic.** Guitars, music, gear - you know the drill.
4. **Disagree respectfully.** Strats vs. Teles debates are welcome. Personal attacks are not.

That's it. Pull up a chair.

## 🔧 Guitar Tech & Repair

**Title:** Welcome, Tinkerers

**Post:**

Welcome to the workshop.

Some of us learned the hard way that a quick YouTube video and confidence don't always mix. Others have been setting up their own guitars for decades. This forum is for all of us.

Ask questions. Share what you've learned. Help someone avoid the mistake you made.

**Guidelines:**

1. **No stupid questions.** Everyone starts somewhere.
2. **Be specific.** "My guitar sounds weird" is hard to diagnose. "Buzzing on the 5th fret, low E string" helps.
3. **Share your wins AND your fails.** Both teach us something.
4. **When in doubt, recommend a pro.** Some jobs are best left to experts, and that's okay.

Happy wrenching.

## 🎸 Show & Tell

**Title:** Pull up a chair, show us what you got

**Post:**

This is our favorite corner of TWNG.

Not because of the pretty guitars (though those are nice). Because of the stories behind them.

That dent on the body? There's a story there.
The strap that doesn't match? Someone gave it to you.
The sticker you can't remove? 2003 was a weird year.

Don't just post specs. Tell us what this guitar means to you. Where did it come from? What has it been through? What songs did you write on it at 2am when you couldn't sleep?

**What belongs here:**
- Your guitars (any condition, any price range)
- Your setup / pedalboard / amp corner
- Before & after restoration photos
- "Just got this" excitement
- "Had this for 30 years" appreciation

**What doesn't belong:**
Judgment. A $200 Squier with a story beats a $5,000 wall hanger any day.

## 💰 Market Talk

**Title:** Welcome to Market Talk

**Post:**

Let's talk money.

Guitars aren't just instruments - they're assets, collectibles, sometimes investments. Prices go up, bubbles burst, hidden gems get discovered, and "overpriced" is always relative.

This is the place to discuss values, trends, and the market. What's worth it? What's overhyped? What should you grab before prices climb?

**Guidelines:**

1. **Opinions welcome, arguments not.** "I think X is overpriced" is fine. "You're an idiot for paying that" is not.
2. **Share your knowledge.** If you know something about a particular model's history or value - tell us.
3. **No actual buying/selling here.** This is for discussion only.
4. **Be honest about what you don't know.** The market is weird. Nobody has all the answers.
