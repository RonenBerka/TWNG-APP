## Section 2: The Problem

### Headline:
> Where do your guitars live today?

### Body:
> In a spreadsheet? A folder of photos? Your memory?
>
> You know every scratch, every story, every moment with your guitars.
>
> But there's never been a proper place to keep all of it —
> the specs, the photos, the serial numbers, and the stories that make each one yours.
>
> Until now.

### Visual:
Scattered photos, a spreadsheet, a dusty guitar case — the "before" state.

### Sub:
> Everything about your collection, in one beautiful place. Unlimited. Free.

**2. All the Details**
> Specs, serial numbers, photos from every angle. AI helps you capture it all in seconds — not hours.

**3. Your Guitars. Your Way.**

### Steps:

**3. Choose who sees**
> Keep it private, share with friends, or go public. Change anytime.
