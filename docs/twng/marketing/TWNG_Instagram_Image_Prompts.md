## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Guitar Accuracy

**Guitar collectors notice every detail. Inaccurate guitars destroy credibility.**

Every image prompt MUST include:
- **Inlays at frets 3-5-7-9-12** (standard dot pattern)
- **Correct headstock:** Fender 6-in-line, Gibson 3+3
- **Correct body shape:** Stratocaster double cutaway, Les Paul single cutaway
- **Correct pickups:** Strat 3 single-coils, Les Paul 2 humbuckers
- **Correct bridge:** Strat tremolo, Les Paul Tune-o-matic

**We are dealing with guitar memories — accuracy is non-negotiable.**

## Image 1: The 70s — Red Stratocaster

### Prompt:

```
Cinematic photograph, 1970s America. A teenage boy, around 15-16 years old, receiving his first electric guitar — a red Fender Stratocaster.

The scene is a modest living room, Christmas morning or birthday. Wood-paneled walls, shag carpet, warm tungsten lighting. The boy is holding the guitar for the first time, face lit with wonder and disbelief.

He's wearing a band t-shirt (Led Zeppelin or similar era), long hair parted in the middle, bell-bottom jeans. His parents are partially visible in the background, smiling.

The guitar is bright candy apple red, gleaming under the warm light. The original case is open on the floor.

Shot on film, Kodak Ektachrome color palette. Soft grain, slightly faded colors typical of 70s photography. Golden hour indoor lighting. Shallow depth of field, focus on the boy's expression and the guitar.

Mood: Pure joy, possibility, the beginning of something. Nostalgic, authentic, emotional.

Aspect ratio 4:5 (Instagram portrait)

1974.

The moment everything changed.

A red Stratocaster. Christmas morning.
A kid who didn't know yet that this guitar would be with him for 50 years.

## Image 2: The 80s — Classical Guitar

### Prompt:

```
Cinematic photograph, 1980s America. A teenage girl, around 13-14 years old, receiving her first classical guitar as a gift.

The scene is a suburban home, perhaps a birthday party. The room has 80s decor — pastel colors, floral wallpaper, maybe a boombox visible in the background. Daylight coming through venetian blinds creating striped shadows.

The girl is sitting on a bed or couch, holding the nylon-string classical guitar carefully, looking at it with a mix of curiosity and excitement. She's wearing period-appropriate clothing — maybe a pastel sweater, scrunchie in her hair, high-waisted jeans.

The guitar is a warm honey-colored classical guitar with a natural wood finish. Simple and beautiful.

Shot on film, Fuji color palette typical of 80s photography. Soft, slightly overexposed highlights. The image has that warm, hazy quality of 80s snapshots.

Mood: Intimate, hopeful, the quiet beginning of a passion. A private moment of discovery.

Aspect ratio 4:5 (Instagram portrait)

## Image 3: The 90s — Bass in the Garage

### Prompt:

```
Cinematic photograph, 1990s America. A teenage boy, around 14-15 years old, practicing bass guitar alone in a suburban garage.

The garage is converted into a makeshift practice space. Concrete floor, exposed walls with band posters (Nirvana, Green Day, Red Hot Chili Peppers). A small practice amp, some cables on the floor. Maybe a drum kit partially visible. Overhead fluorescent light mixed with daylight from a partially open garage door.

The boy is sitting on a folding chair or amp, concentrating intensely, fingers on the fretboard of a Fender Precision Bass or similar. He's wearing baggy jeans, a flannel shirt or oversized band t-shirt, maybe a backwards cap. Skate shoes.

The bass guitar is a classic sunburst or black Precision Bass — worn, maybe his older brother's or bought used.

Shot with the aesthetic of 90s photography — slightly desaturated, cool tones, that specific 90s film quality. Maybe slight motion blur on the hands to show he's playing.

Mood: Determination, solitude, the grind of learning. Raw, authentic, DIY spirit of the 90s.

Aspect ratio 4:5 (Instagram portrait)
```

### Caption:

1994.

Every day after school. Same garage. Same four notes.

## Image 4: Recording Studio — Waiting

### Prompt:

```
Cinematic photograph. A vintage electric guitar leaning against a wooden stool in a professional recording studio.

Warm, moody lighting from a single lamp or soft studio light. Mixing console blurred in background, analog equipment with glowing VU meters, cables coiled on the floor. The guitar is bathed in golden light, waiting for its moment.

No people in frame — but you feel their presence. A cup of coffee on a nearby surface, a notebook with handwritten lyrics, headphones resting on the console.

1970s/80s studio aesthetic — wood panels, warm tones, analog equipment. The room feels lived-in, creative, full of history.

Shot on film. Rich shadows, warm highlights. Grain visible. The guitar is the subject, everything else serves the atmosphere.

Mood: Anticipation. The quiet moment before something is created. 3am energy.

Aspect ratio 4:5 (Instagram portrait)

### Caption:

## Image 5: Guitar Shop — First Touch

### Prompt:

```
Cinematic photograph. Close-up of a hand reaching out to touch an electric guitar hanging on a wall in a guitar shop.

Dozens of guitars visible in soft focus behind — a wall of possibilities. The hand is hesitant, reverent — the moment of first contact with the one.

Warm tungsten lighting typical of guitar stores. Wood, chrome, and glass display cases in the background. Price tags visible but not readable.

Shot from behind the shoulder, intimate perspective. We see what they see. Shallow depth of field — the hand and guitar neck sharp, everything else dreamy.

The guitar could be a Les Paul, a Telecaster, or a semi-hollow — something classic and desirable.

Mood: Desire. Longing. The moment before a decision that changes everything.

## Image 6: Passing It Down — Generations

### Prompt:

```
Emotional photograph. Close-up of two pairs of hands — elderly weathered hands carefully passing an acoustic guitar to young hands reaching to receive it.

Only the hands and guitar visible in frame. The guitar is worn, loved, has decades of history visible in every scratch and worn fret. A Martin, Gibson, or similar classic acoustic.

Soft natural light from a window. Shallow depth of field. The moment of transfer is happening in the center of frame — the guitar suspended between generations.

The elderly hands show age — wrinkles, spots, but gentle and careful. The young hands are eager but respectful.

Mood: Legacy. Love. Continuation. A story being passed forward. Bittersweet and beautiful.

Aspect ratio 4:5 (Instagram portrait)
```

### Caption:
```
"It's yours now."

Three words.
Fifty years of songs.

## Image 7: The Forgotten Guitar — In the Closet

### Prompt:

```
Moody, melancholic photograph. An acoustic guitar visible inside a dark closet, partially hidden between hanging clothes and stacked boxes.

A single beam of light cuts through the darkness — maybe from a cracked door or a gap in the clothes. Dust particles visible floating in the light. The guitar is dusty but still beautiful, waiting.

The closet is cluttered with life — winter coats, boxes labeled with marker, forgotten things. But the guitar stands out.

Muted colors, low contrast, the feeling of something abandoned but not gone.

Mood: Abandonment. Nostalgia. But also hope — it's still there, waiting to be remembered.

Aspect ratio 4:5 (Instagram portrait)

### Caption:

## Image 8: After the Show — Empty Stage

### Prompt:

```
Cinematic wide photograph. An electric guitar lying flat on an empty stage after a concert.

The house lights are on — harsh work lights replacing the magic of the show. Rows of empty seats stretch into darkness. Cables still scattered, a setlist taped to the floor, maybe a drumstick left behind.

The guitar lies center stage, alone. A Les Paul or similar, still plugged in, still warm from the set.

The contrast between the energy that was here and the emptiness now. Beautiful loneliness.

Cool tones, slight blue cast from the work lights. The guitar is small in the frame but draws the eye.

Mood: The quiet after the storm. Exhaustion. What remains when everyone leaves.

Aspect ratio 4:5 (Instagram portrait)
```

### Caption:

The crowd is gone.
The lights are harsh.
The magic faded.

But the guitar stays.

## Image 9: The Luthier — Hands at Work

### Prompt:

```
Detailed close-up photograph. A craftsman's hands working on a guitar — adjusting the truss rod, polishing frets, or carefully restringing.

A luthier's workbench fills the background in soft focus — specialized tools, wood shavings, small parts in organized containers. Warm workshop lighting, maybe a single bright work lamp.

The hands are weathered, skilled, patient. Every movement is careful and deliberate. The guitar is partially disassembled or in the middle of a setup.

Rich wood tones, warm highlights on the hands and guitar. The feeling of craft, care, restoration.

Mood: Dedication. Craftsmanship. Bringing something back to life with love.

Aspect ratio 4:5 (Instagram portrait)
```

### Caption:
```
Some guitars need saving.

Someone brings it in —
scratched, neglected, silent for years.

## Image 10: Road Trip — Guitar in the Backseat

### Prompt:

```
Candid photograph from inside a car. A guitar case lying across the backseat, seen in the rearview mirror or over the shoulder from the driver's perspective.

The open road visible through the windshield — highway stretching ahead, golden hour light flooding in. The guitar case is secured like a passenger, a worn sticker or two visible on its surface.

Windows slightly down, the feeling of movement and freedom. Maybe a hand on the steering wheel visible at the edge of frame.

Warm, golden tones. The feeling of summer, travel, possibility. Film aesthetic with slight lens flare from the sun.

Mood: Adventure. Freedom. The guitar as companion on the journey.
