## Dating Without Serial Numbers

Since most of these brands lacked consistent serial numbers, use:

1. **Pot Codes**
   - Format: 137-XXYY (137 = CTS, XX = year, YY = week)
   - Example: 137-6520 = 1965, week 20

2. **Catalog Research**
   - vintageguitarandbass.com for original catalogs
   - Match features to catalog year

3. **Construction Changes**
   - Pickup designs changed over years
   - Tuner styles evolved
   - Logo/headstock shapes changed

4. **Hardware Dating**
   - Kluson tuners have date codes
   - Bridge styles indicate eras
