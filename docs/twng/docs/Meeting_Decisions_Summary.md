## Two Key Decisions

### 1. Privacy Model: User Choice (Option C)

**Decision:** המשתמש בוחר את הנראות של כל גיטרה.

| Setting | Hebrew | Who Sees |
|---------|--------|----------|
| 🔒 Private | פרטי | Only you |
| 🔗 Link | קישור | Anyone with link |
| 🌐 Public | ציבורי | Everyone (searchable) |

**Implications:**
- +1 step in onboarding (visibility selection)
- Marketing & Gallery features for public guitars
- My Collection + Feed for personal use
- Community features available for those who choose public

**Messaging:**
- "Your guitars. Your way."
- "You decide who sees"
- "Private or public — your choice"
- גמישות, בחירה
