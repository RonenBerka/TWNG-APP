## 1. Fender

Fender identification relies heavily on the evolution of Stratocaster and Telecaster headstocks, which serve as the primary canvas for the brand logo. Changes in headstock design are not arbitrary — they reflect corporate transitions and historical shifts.

### 1.1 Logo Typology & Placement

The Fender logo is the starting point for any inspection. Major variants and their era associations:

**Spaghetti Logo** (1950s original)
- Thin, handwritten-style silver script with delicate black outlines
- Currently appears on Reissue models (Vintera, American Original series) that replicate the 1950s aesthetic
- Presence indicates vintage-recreation intent

**Transition Logo** (mid-1960s)
- Letters became thicker and gold, with more prominent black outline
- Marks the transition from Leo Fender's ownership to CBS acquisition

**Black Logo** (CBS Era, 1970s)
- Black, bold, blocky lettering designed for TV visibility in that era
- Currently appears on Vintera models representing the 1970s
- Associated with large headstock era

**Modern "Spaghetti" (silver/gold)**
- On modern series (Player = Mexico, Professional = USA), Fender returned to a spaghetti-style logo but cleaner and sharper
- On American Ultra models: metallic foil appliqué (embossed), signaling luxury and modernity

### 1.2 Headstock Geometry

Fender headstocks are asymmetric with 6-in-line tuners. The critical historical dividing line is headstock size:

**Small Headstock (Pre-CBS, 1954–1965)**
- Elegant and narrow
- Truss rod adjustment typically at the neck heel (body end), leaving the headstock face clean except for logo and walnut plug around string hole
- Indicator of pre-CBS era or models replicating that period

**Large Headstock (CBS Era, 1965–1981)**
- Significantly wider — the marketing goal was to enlarge the logo area for close-up visibility
- Often features a protruding "Bullet" truss rod nut on the headstock face
- Associated with 3-bolt neck attachment (vs. the standard 4-bolt)

### 1.3 Secondary Body & Hardware Markers

**Bridges:**
- Player series: 2-point modern tremolo with bent steel saddles
- Vintage models (Vintera): 6-screw classic system
- Telecaster "Ashtray" bridge with 3 brass saddles = vintage direction
- Flat bridge with 6 modern saddles = standard/modern series

**S-1 Switch:**
- On elite models (American Ultra), the volume knob contains a push-button switch (S-1) that rewires the pickups
- Subtle but decisive visual marker for advanced electronics not visible at a glance

### 1.4 Fender Quick-Reference Table

| Model/Series | Logo | Headstock | Body & Hardware |
|---|---|---|---|
| Strat (50s/60s Style) | "Spaghetti" (thin silver) or "Transition" (gold), centered on headstock | Small (Pre-CBS), clean face, no protruding truss rod | 6-screw vintage tremolo, bent vintage saddles, SSS pickups |
| Strat (70s Style) | Black Logo (thick, bold, large) | Large (CBS), significantly wider | 6-screw or 2-point bridge, sometimes 3-bolt neck joint |
| Player Series | Modern silver spaghetti, "Stratocaster" in small sans-serif | Small headstock, standard | 2-point bridge, 22 frets (vs 21 on vintage), "F" logo on neckplate (some models) |
| American Ultra | Metallic foil (gold/silver), embossed | Small headstock, locking tuners with F logo | Ergonomic body contours at neck heel, S-1 switch in volume, Noiseless pickups |
| Telecaster | Thin spaghetti or modern | Narrower and longer than Strat | Single cutaway body. Bridge: 3 saddles (vintage) or 6 saddles (modern) |

## 2. Gibson

Gibson maintains a more conservative visual identity than Fender. The smallest nuances distinguish a $1,000 instrument from a $5,000 one.

### 2.1 Headstock Geometry & Logo

**"Open Book" Shape**
- The upper profile of the headstock, resembling an open book or mustache, is Gibson's most distinctive identifier
- Epiphone (subsidiary) used different variants ("Clipped Ear") historically, but since 2020 adopted the "Kalamazoo" headstock that closely mimics Gibson's shape with slightly more pronounced curves

**Logo Inlay:**
- Premium models (Standard, Custom): Mother of Pearl inlay
- Budget models (Tribute, Studio in some generations): Gold silkscreen decal

**The "i" Dot:**
- Critical forensic detail for collectors: In certain periods (late 1960s, early 1970s), the dot above the letter 'i' in "Gibson" disappeared, then returned later
- Missing dot = helps date the instrument to the Norlin Era

**Split Diamond:**
- Status symbol appearing ONLY on Custom models
- Large, ornate inlay at headstock center
- Immediately distinguishes Les Paul Standard from Les Paul Custom

### 2.2 Structural Markers: Les Paul & SG

**Les Paul Standard vs Studio:**
- Most visible difference: Binding (decorative edge strip)
- Standard: cream-colored binding around body AND neck
- Studio: No binding at all — clean but less luxurious appearance
- Studio body may be slightly thinner

**SG Standard:**
- Identified by "Crown" or "Flowerpot" inlay at headstock center
- SG Special or Tribute: typically plain gold logo without center inlay
- Body bevels vary by era — 1960s reissues have deeper, more sculptural bevels than modern standards

### 2.3 Flying V & Explorer

**Flying V:**
- Arrowhead-shaped headstock
- Logo often on a raised plastic plaque (not directly on wood) on vintage/'67 models, though modern models vary

**Explorer:**
- "Hockey Stick" or "Banana" headstock, angled downward
- Tuners in 6-in-line arrangement (unlike Gibson's standard 3+3)

### 2.4 Gibson Quick-Reference Table

| Model/Series | Logo | Headstock | Body & Hardware |
|---|---|---|---|
| Les Paul Standard | Mother of Pearl "Gibson" inlay. Gold handwritten "Les Paul Model" centered | Classic "Open Book" | Body and neck binding (cream). Maple top (often flamed). Vintage-style tulip tuners |
| Les Paul Custom | Pearl inlay + large "Split Diamond" center inlay | "Open Book" (sometimes slightly wider) | Multi-ply binding on body and headstock. Gold hardware. Ebony fretboard |
| Les Paul Studio | Gold decal (silkscreen) or simple inlay (varies by year) | "Open Book" | No binding. Clean, simple look. Dots or trapezoids on fretboard |
| SG Standard | Pearl inlay + "Crown" center inlay | "Open Book" | Thin mahogany body with double cutaway (horns). "Batwing" pickguard (full or small, varies by year) |
| Flying V | Raised plastic plaque logo ('67 models) or decal | Arrowhead | V-shaped body. Unique button layout (triangle or row). Tune-o-Matic bridge |
| Explorer | Gold/silver decal at headstock tip | "Hockey Stick" (banana), angled down | Angular asymmetric body. 6-in-line tuners |

## 3. Super-Strat & Metal

In the 1980s, the electric guitar mutated into a high-performance instrument. Identification focuses on pointed headstocks, graphic logos, and advanced hardware (Floyd Rose).

### 3.1 Ibanez

**Logo:** The "Checkmark" (V symbol) is standard. On Prestige models (Japan): metallic or pearl finish with small "Prestige" text. On Premium models: text appears but logo may be a regular decal.

**RG Headstock:** A pointed, aggressive variation of the Fender shape with a sharp "beak."

**Key Series Identification:**

*JEM / PIA (Steve Vai signature):*
- JEM: immediately identified by the Monkey Grip (handle cutout in body) and "Lion's Claw" tremolo cavity routing behind the floating bridge
- PIA (newer): replaces the handle with "Petal" (flower petal) cutouts

*AZ Series:*
- Targets the boutique-modern market
- Headstock slightly more rounded and classic than RG
- More modern logo style
- Roasted Maple neck (darker color)
- Gotoh non-locking bridge (unlike the Edge locking bridge on RG)

### 3.2 Jackson & Charvel

These brands share history but are visually distinct:

**Jackson:**
- "Concorde" pointed headstock (like an aircraft nose)
- Sharp, angular "Jackson" script logo
- Critical identifier: "Sharkfin" fretboard inlays on premium models (cheaper models use dots)
- Rhoads model: asymmetric V with shorter lower horn

**Charvel:**
- Uses a licensed Fender Stratocaster headstock (or very similar variant)
- "Guitar Logo" — script in the shape of a guitar
- Key identification: the combination of a "classic" headstock with a Super-Strat body featuring humbuckers and a floating bridge — uncommon on traditional Fenders

### 3.3 Kramer

- **"Banana" headstock:** curved upward, resembling a hockey stick or banana
- **Logo:** Blocky, bold "KRAMER" text
- **Baretta model:** single angled humbucker in the bridge position — a visually unmistakable marker of aggressive simplicity

### 3.4 Super-Strat & Metal Quick-Reference Table

| Brand & Model | Logo | Headstock | Unique Body/Hardware Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ibanez RG | "Ibanez" with "V" checkmark above, at headstock tip | Pointed, aggressive | Sharp-horned body. Floating bridge (Edge/Lo-Pro). Sharktooth inlays (many models) |
| Ibanez S Series | Same | Pointed | Extremely thin body edges (Saber) with thicker center |
| Ibanez JEM | Colorful/special logo | Pointed | Monkey Grip (handle) in body. "Tree of Life" neck inlay |
| Jackson Soloist | Jagged white/pearl "Jackson" | "Concorde" (pointed downward) | Neck-through construction. Sharkfin inlays |
| Jackson Rhoads | Same | "Concorde" | Asymmetric V body (longer upper horn) |
| Charvel San Dimas | "Charvel" guitar-shaped script | Stratocaster headstock (licensed) | Strat body with humbuckers (HH/HSS), usually no pickguard or small one. Floyd Rose |
| Kramer Baretta | Blocky "KRAMER" | "Banana" / Hockey Stick | Single angled pickup at bridge. Modified Strat body |
| Schecter Hellraiser | Gothic-style logo | Rounded with sharp elements | Abalone binding around body and headstock. Gothic cross fretboard inlays |
| ESP / LTD EC | ESP or LTD (blocky modern) | "Viper" or asymmetric cut | Single-cut body (Les Paul-like) with belly cut and sharper contours. Flag inlays |

## 4. Boutique & Modern

Brands that refined classic designs using exotic woods and proprietary hardware as visual signatures.

### 4.1 Paul Reed Smith (PRS)

**Headstock:** Unique asymmetric shape with a "scoop" in the upper profile.

**Logo:** Paul Reed Smith's signature. On SE (Student Edition): earlier models had a large "SE" text; newer models show a smaller signature logo with subdued "SE" text.

**Bird Inlays:**
- THE most recognizable PRS marker
- Core (USA): abalone or mother of pearl with fine detail
- S2 and SE: simpler or synthetic material

**Body Carve:**
- Core (Custom 24 etc.): deep "Violin Carve" — sculptural and pronounced
- S2 and SE: "Beveled Top" (flatter with angled edges) or "Shallow Violin"
- Difference visible in how light reflects off the body surface

### 4.2 Ernie Ball Music Man

**Headstock:** The 4+2 tuner arrangement (4 on top, 2 on bottom) is the trademark. This shortens the headstock and eliminates the need for string trees.

**Key Models:**
- *Majesty (John Petrucci):* Futuristic design, shield inlay at first position, recessed body controls, often carbon fiber finishes
- *StingRay Guitar:* Offset body, chrome control plate (reminiscent of the bass), oval pickguard

### 4.3 Suhr & Tom Anderson

**Suhr:** Headstock is a Fender variation with a carved "step" near the volute and a more curved bottom. Logo is an elegant, simple serif font.

**Tom Anderson:** Known for the A-Wedgie neck joint (only two bolts) visible from the back — a trapezoid shape that eliminates the need for a rectangular neck plate. A unique mechanical visual marker.

## 5. Acoustic Steel-String

Acoustic identification relies less on body color and more on structural geometries: bridge shape, pickguard, headstock trim.

### 5.1 C.F. Martin

**Headstock:** Square taper, simple. Logo is typically a gold script decal with black outline.

**Bridge:** "Belly Bridge" is standard. On vintage and reissue models (D-28, D-18), the belly is behind the pins.

**Series Identification by Style Number:**
- Style 18: Mahogany back/sides (brown), simple black binding
- Style 28: Rosewood back/sides (dark/chocolate), white multi-layer binding
- D-35: **Three-piece back** (center wood triangle on guitar back) — unlike the 2-piece back on D-28. Visually prominent from behind.

### 5.2 Taylor

**Headstock:** Smooth "Paddle" shape, more rounded than Martin.

**Bridge:** Unique Taylor design — lacks Martin's sharp corners, with a gentle wavy contour. Pins sometimes arranged in a slight arc.

**Series Identification:**
- GS Mini: Small body (travel), no cutaway (usually), 3-ring rosette. Arched back (no visible internal bracing through the soundhole)
- 300 Series: Entry-level solid-wood series. Usually Sapele (striped) or Blackwood, satin finish
- V-Class Bracing: On newer models, black graphite nut and internal label clearly stating "V-Class"

### 5.3 Guild

- "Chesterfield" inlay (column/capitol) on headstock = premium American models (like D-55)
- Pickguard has a unique shape, distinct from Martin's teardrop

### 5.4 Gibson Acoustic

- "Open Book" headstock
- J-45: "Slope Shoulder" body (rounded shoulders) distinguishing it from Martin's square Dreadnought
- "Reverse Belly" bridge (belly faces toward the soundhole)

### 5.5 Acoustic Quick-Reference Table

| Brand & Model | Logo | Headstock | Body & Bridge |
|---|---|---|---|
| Martin D-28 | Gold script decal | Square Taper, simple | Standard belly bridge. Rosewood 2-piece back. White binding |
| Martin D-18 | Same | Same | Mahogany back. Dark/black binding |
| Martin D-35 | Same | Same | 3-piece back with binding strips between. White neck binding |
| Taylor 814ce | Mother of pearl "Taylor" inlay | Rounded Paddle | Grand Auditorium body (narrow waist). Armrest (some new models). Wavy Taylor bridge |
| Taylor GS Mini | Screen print logo | Smaller headstock | Small (travel) body. Arched back (no back bracing) |
| Gibson J-45 | Script + "Banner" decal (some models) | Open Book | Slope Shoulder body. Reverse Belly bridge. Classic sunburst finish |
| Guild D-55 | G-Shield or Chesterfield inlay | Large, rounded top with indent | V-Block inlays with triangles. Unique pickguard shape |
| Takamine | Angled script logo | Pointed asymmetric (some models) | Split Saddle (two-piece for better intonation). CoolTube preamp (premium models) |
| Ovation | Logo on "Axe" headstock | Unique shape | Roundback body (Lyrachord composite). Multiple small soundholes (Epaulets) on Elite models |

## 6. Classical & Nylon

Classical guitar differences are subtle — look for headstock slots, tie-block details, and rosette patterns.

### 6.1 Cordoba

**Series:**
- Iberia (C5, C7): Traditional headstock. C5 = mahogany back (brown), C7 = rosewood back (dark). Logo is a crest at the headstock top
- Fusion: Narrower neck (48mm vs 52mm standard), radiused fretboard. Cutaway as standard. Tie block may include pearl inlay

### 6.2 Alhambra

- Headstock: Design varies by model (higher-end models may have an "A" carved into the headstock cutout)
- Numbering system: 1C–3C = entry level, minimal ornamentation. Line P (4P, 7P) = rosewood models. 7P and above = all solid wood with visible grain matching between interior and exterior

### 6.3 Yamaha

- Logo: The tuning forks symbol is the identifier
- C40: World's most common student model. Decal rosette (sticker, not inlaid wood). Meranti back (plain, uniform texture)
- NTX/NCX: Electro-acoustic series. NTX has a thinner body and sometimes oval soundholes. Side-mounted Atmosfeel controls visible

---

## 7. Bass Guitars

Bass identification focuses on body construction and exotic woods as primary visual elements.

### 7.1 Warwick

**Headstock:** "Gumby" shape (angled downward). Tuners face toward the player at an angle.

**Woods:** Warwick frequently uses Wenge (very dark with coarse grain) and Bubinga (reddish, mottled) with Natural Oil Finish (no thick lacquer). The wood texture IS part of the identification.

**Bridge:** Two-piece system (separate Tailpiece and Bridge) is a distinctive marker.

**Models:**
- Thumb: Small, compact body with concave back (for comfort)
- Corvette: Very long upper horn reaching to fret 12, flat body

### 7.2 Spector

**Body:** The NS shape (designed by Ned Steinberger). Body is fully curved (convex) to conform to the player's body — a critical visual difference from the flat-bodied Warwick Corvette.

**Headstock:** Similar to Warwick but less exaggerated, with "SS" double logo.

### 7.3 Music Man Basses

- **StingRay:** Oval/egg-shaped pickguard. Single large humbucker pickup at the "sweet spot" with exposed large pole pieces. Chrome "banana"-shaped control plate
- **Bongo:** Co-designed with BMW. Aggressive lemon/egg-shaped angular body, usually in opaque finishes. 4+1 or 3+1 headstock in a different design from StingRay

---

## 8. Retro & Niche

### 8.1 Rickenbacker

**Headstock:** Logo appears on an oversized plastic truss rod cover (white/gold) that covers most of the headstock face. Headstock shape is unique and nearly impossible to replicate.

**Body:**
- 300 series (330, 360): "Cresting Wave" shape
- 360: features a "German Carve" (stepped contour) on the upper surface with rounded corners
- 330: sharp corners ("horns")

**Hardware:** "R"-shaped tailpiece. Stereo outputs (Rick-O-Sound) on premium models.

### 8.2 Danelectro

**Headstock:** "Coke Bottle" shape.

**Body:** Made of Masonite (compressed fiberboard) with "Vinyl Tape Binding" in snakeskin or other textures around the sides — a feature unique to this brand.

**Pickups:** "Lipstick" — chrome tubes containing the coil.

### 8.3 B.C. Rich

Extreme body shapes:
- Warlock: Jagged X shape
- Mockingbird: More flowing but with spikes
- Ironbird: Angular arrow
- "Widow" headstock: symmetric with pointed sides — a classic

### 8.4 Dean

- The large, split "V" headstock (resembling a pitchfork) is the identifier for ML models (Dimebag Darrell)

---

## 9. Lawsuit Era & Japanese Copies

Collectors frequently encounter Japanese guitars from the 1970s/80s that closely copy Gibson and Fender. Identification requires close inspection.

### 9.1 Legitimacy: Lawsuit Era vs. Counterfeit

This distinction matters because users often ask "is this legit?" when they see a guitar that looks like a Gibson or Fender but carries a different name. The answer depends on whether it's a Lawsuit Era instrument or an actual counterfeit:

**Lawsuit Era (1970s–mid 1980s) = LEGITIMATE instruments**
- Manufactured under their own brand names: Tokai, Burny, Greco, Orville, Edwards, etc.
- Sold openly as Japanese-made copies — not disguised as Gibson or Fender originals
- Legal to manufacture and sell during this period (before trademark enforcement tightened internationally)
- Built with quality materials and craftsmanship, often rivaling or exceeding American originals from the same era
- Highly valued by collectors today. A 1970s–80s Tokai Love Rock or Greco Super Real in good condition can sell for $800–$2,000+
- The name "Lawsuit Era" comes from Gibson/Fender eventually filing lawsuits to stop the copies — but the guitars themselves were legal products

**Counterfeit (any era) = ILLEGITIMATE**
- Headstock logo falsely claims "Gibson", "Fender", or another brand
- Intentionally deceptive branding — designed to fool buyers into thinking they're purchasing the real thing
- Often poor build quality, cheap electronics, and inconsistent construction
- May use stolen serial number formats

**How to tell the difference:**
- Tokai "Love Rock Model" on headstock = Legitimate (their own brand, not claiming to be Gibson)
- Guitar with "Gibson" logo but made by an unknown factory = Counterfeit (false branding)
- The key question: does the headstock honestly identify the maker, or does it pretend to be someone else?

### 9.2 Identifying Specific Lawsuit Era Brands

**Tokai Love Rock:**
- Les Paul copy. Logo reads "Love Rock Model" in a font identical to Gibson's "Les Paul Model"
- Headstock includes a small dimple/indent at the center of the "open book" — slightly different from Gibson
- Early models (pre-1982) often had higher-quality components; later models simplified somewhat
- These are respected instruments — not fakes

**Burny (Fernandes):**
- Lightning bolt logo or split diamond inlay at headstock
- Truss rod cover: bell-shaped but often with 2 screws (Gibson uses 2, but placement differs slightly — some copies use 3)

**Greco:**
- "Super Real" series. Logo mimics Gibson's font almost perfectly
- Check serial number: Greco (and quality Japanese copies) sometimes use a date stamp format in ink similar to 1950s Gibson

### 9.3 General Tips for Identifying Japanese Copies

- Weight: often slightly heavier or lighter than the original
- Headstock angle: may differ by 1-2 degrees
- Fret wire: often narrower than American originals of the same era
- Pot codes and electronics: Japanese components vs. American CTS pots
- Tuner brands: Gotoh or no-name vs. Kluson/Grover originals
