## Guitar Identification Protocol

When identifying a guitar from photos, examine EVERY visible element systematically before making any model guess. Do NOT jump to conclusions. Every non-standard element is a clue. Describe each element by its actual shape/content, never generically.

### Step 1: Headstock

The most information-dense area. Check ALL of the following:

1. **Logo/brand text**: Exact wording, font, material (decal, gold foil, inlaid pearl, painted, engraved)
2. **Graphic inlays between or around tuners**: Often the single strongest identifier. Known examples:
   - **Banjo sketch** → Pete Seeger models (Martin JSO/J12SO)
   - **Birds** → PRS (different birds = different model tiers)
   - **Crown** → Fender Custom Shop
   - **Split diamond** → Martin Style 28+
   - **Torch/flowerpot** → Martin Style 42/45
   - **Clover/shamrock** → Collings
   - **Trident** → Suhr
   - **Tree of life** → Ibanez high-end
   - **Flying V shape** → Dean
   - **Star** → Various makers
3. **Signatures or handwriting-style inlays**: Almost always an artist signature edition — identify the name FIRST, it overrides all other guesses
4. **Additional text**: Model names, "EST. [year]", anniversary text, "Limited Edition", "Custom Shop", "Authentic", edition numbers
5. **Headstock shape**: Standard vs non-standard for the brand (e.g., slotted vs solid on Martin = classical/vintage influence)
6. **Tuners**: Open-gear, sealed, Grover, Gotoh, Schaller, Waverly, vintage-style, butterbean, keystone — narrows era and price tier
7. **Headplate material**: Ebony, rosewood, painted, natural wood, overlay — indicates model tier
8. **Truss rod cover** (electric/some acoustic): Shape, material, engraved text (e.g., Gibson "Standard", "Custom", "Les Paul Model", blank = Studio)

### Step 2: Neck & Fretboard Inlays

Fretboard inlays are major model identifiers. Examine:

1. **Inlay shape and material**:
   - **Dots** → Standard/entry level on most brands
   - **Blocks/rectangles** → Gibson Les Paul Custom, Standard 50s; Fender Jazzmasters; higher-tier models
   - **Trapezoids** → Gibson Les Paul Standard, SG Standard
   - **Birds** → PRS (specific bird species at each fret = model identifier)
   - **Shark fins** → Jackson high-end
   - **Offset dots** → Rickenbacker, some Eric Johnson models
   - **Snowflakes** → Martin Style 42/45
   - **Hexagons** → old Ibanez models
   - **Roman numerals** → some signature models
   - **Custom graphics** → Signature editions (describe exactly what you see)
   - **No inlays / side dots only** → Some high-end or minimalist models (Martin Authentic, some Custom Shop, Pete Seeger models)
2. **Inlay material**: Mother of pearl, abalone, acrylic, clay, glow-in-dark — narrows era and tier
3. **Fret markers at which frets**: Standard (3,5,7,9,12,15,17,19,21) vs non-standard positions
4. **12th fret special inlay**: Many brands use a unique marker at fret 12 (double dots, special design, logo)
5. **Fretboard material**: Ebony (high-end), rosewood (mid-high), pau ferro (modern mid), maple (Fender), richlite (modern Gibson budget)
6. **Binding on fretboard**: Indicates higher-tier model (e.g., Gibson Custom vs Standard)
7. **Number of frets**: 20 (acoustic standard), 21 (vintage Fender), 22 (Gibson/modern Fender), 24 (shred/modern)

### Step 3: Body Front

1. **Soundhole shape** (acoustic): Round (standard), oval (Ovation/Breedlove), **triangular** (Pete Seeger Martin), D-shaped, offset, multiple small holes (Lowden, some Breedlove)
2. **Rosette pattern**: Herringbone (Martin 28 series), abalone (Style 40+), simple rings (Style 18 and below), colored wood mosaic, none
3. **Binding**: Ivoroid (mid-high Martin/Gibson), wood (Collings/Santa Cruz), abalone (Style 45), multi-ply, none (entry level), herringbone purfling
4. **Top wood**: Spruce (most common), cedar (classical/fingerstyle), maple (archtop), koa, redwood — grain pattern and color visible
5. **Finish**: Gloss, satin, vintage toner/aging, sunburst pattern (2-tone, 3-tone), natural, painted — era and model clues
6. **Cutaway**: Venetian (rounded), Florentine (pointed), none — narrows body model
7. **Pickup configuration** (electric):
   - HH (two humbuckers) → Les Paul, SG, many PRS
   - SSS (three single coils) → Stratocaster
   - SS (two single coils) → Telecaster, Jazzmaster
   - HSS, HSH → Modern/super strat
   - P-90s → Gibson Special, Junior, some SG
   - Filtertrons → Gretsch
8. **Pickup covers/bezels**: Chrome, gold, nickel, cream, zebra, open-coil, soapbar — model/era clues
9. **Control layout** (electric): Number and position of knobs, switch type and position — brand identifier

### Step 4: Pickguard

Pickguards are strong identifiers — shape, color, material, and attachment all matter:

1. **Material and color**: Tortoiseshell (vintage Gibson/Martin), black (modern standard), white/cream (Fender), clear, red (some Taylor), pearloid
2. **Shape**: Teardrop (Martin dreadnought), ornate (Gibson hummingbird), Fender Strat shape, Les Paul bracket, none (many modern acoustics)
3. **Split/double pickguard** → Pete Seeger Martin models specifically
4. **Mounting**: Adhesive (most acoustic), screw-mounted (most electric, some acoustic)
5. **Ply count**: Single-ply, 3-ply (white-black-white = Fender vintage), 4-ply
6. **Engraved or decorated pickguard**: Hummingbird (Gibson Hummingbird), floral (Gibson Dove), custom art (signature models)
7. **Absence of pickguard**: Deliberate on some models (Martin Authentic, many fingerstyle models) — not a sign of removal

### Step 5: Bridge & Tailpiece

1. **Acoustic bridge**: Standard belly (Martin), pyramid belly (vintage Martin, Pete Seeger models), pin bridge, pinless (classical, some Taylor), moustache bridge (Gibson vintage)
2. **Electric bridge**: Tune-o-matic (Gibson), tremolo/vibrato (Fender), hardtail, Floyd Rose, Bigsby, wraparound
3. **Bridge material**: Ebony, rosewood, bone saddle, synthetic, metal
4. **Saddle**: Bone, Tusq, compensated, drop-in — affects era dating
5. **Tailpiece** (electric): Stop bar, trapeze, Bigsby vibrato — model and era
6. **String-through body** vs top-loading — Tele/hardtail variant identification

### Step 6: Hardware & Electronics

1. **Knob style**: Speed knobs (Gibson), dome knobs (Fender), top-hat, witch-hat, chicken-head — brand/era/model
2. **Switch type**: 3-way toggle (Gibson), 5-way blade (Fender), rotary (Gretsch, some jazz)
3. **Output jack**: Side-mounted (most electric), endpin (acoustic/electric), plate-mounted (Tele/Les Paul)
4. **Strap buttons**: Standard, locking, endpin location
5. **Hardware finish**: Chrome, nickel, gold, black, aged/relic — indicates tier and era

### Step 7: Back, Sides & Body Shape

1. **Back graphics and markings**: The back can carry definitive identifiers:
   - **Painted or inlaid artwork** → Signature/limited editions (e.g., Gibson SJ-200 custom art backs, Blueridge commemorative models)
   - **Artist signature or autograph** → Signature edition — identify the name
   - **Brand logo or emblem** → Some makers place logos on the back (e.g., Ovation bowl-back logo, Taylor expression system label)
   - **Serial number or factory stamp** → Often stamped or written on the back of the headstock or inside the body near the neck block
   - **Decorative back strip** → Width, material, and pattern of the center seam strip — indicates tier (e.g., Martin zipper backstrip = Style 45)
2. **Back wood and construction**: Rosewood (high-end), mahogany (mid), maple (archtop/some acoustic), sapele, walnut, koa — narrows model. 2-piece, 3-piece, solid, laminate — tier indicator
3. **Body contours and carving**:
   - **Belly cut / tummy cut** → Fender Stratocaster, many modern electrics (absent on Telecaster = identifier)
   - **Forearm contour** → Strat, PRS, many ergonomic designs (flat-top Tele lacks this)
   - **Carved/arched top** → Gibson Les Paul, PRS, archtop jazz guitars
   - **Carved back** → Some PRS models, high-end archtops
   - **German carve / scoop** → Recurve around body edge (Collings, some boutique makers)
   - **Comfort edge / rolled edge** → Taylor, some modern acoustics
   - **Unusual body shape or asymmetry** → Likely signature/custom model — describe the exact shape
4. **Neck joint**: Dovetail (traditional acoustic/Gibson), bolt-on (Fender), set-neck, neck-through — visible from the back
5. **Neck heel shape**: Rounded, square, sculpted/contoured — narrows brand and era (e.g., Taylor NT neck = smooth rounded heel)
6. **Label inside soundhole**: Model name, serial number, signature, edition info, factory location — **check this if any part of it is visible, it often contains definitive identification**
7. **Bracing pattern** (if visible through soundhole): X-bracing, scalloped, forward-shifted, ladder, V-class (Taylor) — era and model
8. **Back bowlness or curvature**: Flat (standard), arched (archtop/Ovation), radiused (McPherson, some carbon fiber)

### Step 8: Year & Vintage Dating

The same model changes over production years. Features from Steps 1-7 also serve as year-dating markers. When the model is identified, compare visible features against known production changes to narrow the year or era:

1. **Logo evolution**: Most brands changed logo fonts, sizes, materials, and positioning over decades. Examples:
   - Martin: Gold decal → pearl inlay → various script styles across eras
   - Gibson: Script logo thickness, dot over "i", font changes mark specific periods
   - Fender: Spaghetti logo → transition logo → CBS-era large headstock → modern
2. **Headstock shape changes**: Fender (small pre-CBS → large CBS → small again), Gibson (open-book variations), Martin (square vs tapered)
3. **Tuner changes**: Brands switch tuner suppliers and styles across eras. Open-gear → sealed → branded. Kluson → Schaller → Grover → Gotoh transitions date production runs
4. **Inlay style and material shifts**: Switch from celluloid to acrylic, pearloid to real pearl, clay dots to plastic — dates specific eras
5. **Pickup changes** (electric): PAF → patent number → T-top → modern (Gibson); gray-bottom → black-bottom (Fender); specific years tied to magnet and bobbin changes
6. **Bridge and saddle evolution**: Martin belly bridge shape changed subtly across decades; Gibson ABR-1 → Nashville bridge; Fender 6-screw → 2-point tremolo
7. **Nut material**: Bone → plastic → Tusq → Corian — production era markers
8. **Binding changes**: Celluloid → ABS → ivoroid shifts across specific years per brand
9. **Pickguard changes**: Material, shape, attachment method, ply count shift across eras — sometimes the fastest year-dating element
10. **Neck profile shifts**: Brands change standard neck profile over time (e.g., Gibson 50s thick → 60s slim taper → modern asymmetric)
11. **Finish type**: Nitrocellulose lacquer (vintage/high-end) → polyurethane/polyester (modern standard) — year and tier marker
12. **Label and serial number format**: Font, layout, ink color, label material, placement — changes per era (see Serial Number Decoding section)
13. **Country of origin markings**: "Made in USA", "Crafted in Japan", factory codes — shifts tied to production relocation dates

**How to use**: Once the model is identified, search "[brand] [model] changes by year" or "[brand] [model] [specific feature] year introduced" to pinpoint the production period based on the combination of observed features.

### Step 9: Cross-Reference All Non-Standard Elements

**Critical rule**: If ANY element across Steps 1-8 is non-standard for the brand, this is likely a signature/artist/limited/custom edition. Search for that specific element BEFORE guessing a standard production model.

Priority order for identification:
1. **Artist signature or name visible anywhere** → search "[brand] [artist name] signature model" — this is almost always definitive
2. **Unique graphic inlay** (headstock or fretboard) → search "[brand] [describe actual shape] inlay model"
3. **Non-standard body/soundhole feature** → search "[brand] [specific feature] guitar model"
4. **Unusual combination of standard features** → search "[brand] [feature A] [feature B] model" (e.g., "Martin ebony fretboard no inlays jumbo body")
5. **Feature combination doesn't match any known year** → possible transition year, custom order, or aftermarket modification — flag and search specifically
6. **Only if nothing unusual found across all steps** → default to standard model identification based on accumulated feature evidence

### Step 10: Consult Forensic ID Database

After completing the visual scan (Steps 1-9), cross-reference your observations against the detailed forensic markers in **`references/forensic-id-database.md`**. That file contains brand-specific identification tables covering:

- **Fender**: Logo variants (Spaghetti, Transition, Black, Modern), headstock sizes (Pre-CBS small vs CBS large), series-specific hardware
- **Gibson**: Open Book headstock, "i" dot dating, Split Diamond (Custom only), binding as tier indicator, Flying V/Explorer headstock variants
- **Super-Strat & Metal**: Ibanez (RG/JEM/AZ), Jackson (Concorde headstock, Sharkfin inlays), Charvel (licensed Fender headstock), Kramer (Banana headstock), Schecter, ESP/LTD
- **Boutique**: PRS (bird inlays, body carve depth by tier), Music Man (4+2 tuners), Suhr, Tom Anderson (A-Wedgie joint)
- **Acoustic**: Martin (Style numbers, belly bridge, 3-piece back on D-35), Taylor (Paddle headstock, V-Class), Guild (Chesterfield inlay), Gibson Acoustic (Slope Shoulder)
- **Classical**: Cordoba, Alhambra, Yamaha
- **Bass**: Warwick (Gumby headstock, Wenge/Bubinga woods), Spector (NS curved body), Music Man (StingRay/Bongo)
- **Retro/Niche**: Rickenbacker (oversized truss rod cover), Danelectro (Masonite + Lipstick pickups), B.C. Rich, Dean
- **Lawsuit Era**: Tokai Love Rock, Burny, Greco — telltale differences from Gibson/Fender originals

Read that file whenever the brand has been narrowed to a specific category and you need the fine details to pinpoint the exact model, series, or era.

## Structured Identification Output

When identifying a guitar (from a photo or text description), present results in this structured format. The goal is to give the user a clear, evidence-based identification rather than a vague guess:

**Format:**

```
## Identification Report

**Brand**: [Brand name]
**Model**: [Model name, e.g., "Les Paul Standard"]
**Series/Tier**: [e.g., "American Ultra", "SE", "Player", "Core"] (if applicable)
**Estimated Era**: [Year range or specific year, e.g., "2018-2022", "Late 1960s (Norlin Era)"]
**Confidence**: [High / Medium / Low]

### Evidence

| Feature | Observed | Indicates |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Logo | [what you see] | [what it means] |
| Headstock | [shape/size] | [what it means] |
| Inlays | [type] | [what it means] |
| Bridge/Hardware | [details] | [what it means] |
| Body | [shape, binding, finish] | [what it means] |

### Reasoning
[1-3 sentences explaining the identification chain: which feature clinched it, any ambiguities]

### Caveats
[Any uncertainties, things that don't quite fit, or elements that couldn't be verified from available information. If none, omit this section.]
```

**Confidence levels:**
- **High**: Multiple features converge on the same identification. Logo, headstock, and hardware all consistent. No contradictions.
- **Medium**: Primary identifiers match but some secondary features are ambiguous, not visible, or slightly atypical.
- **Low**: Identification is based on limited visible features, or there are contradictions between observed elements (possible modifications, parts swap, or copy).

When confidence is Medium or Low, always explain what additional information or angles would help confirm the identification.

### Martin-Specific Identification Markers

| Element | Location | Likely Model/Series |
|---|---|---|
| Banjo sketch + Seeger signature | Headstock | JSO / J12SO Sing Out 60th |
| Torch/flowerpot inlay | Headstock | Style 45 or 42 |
| Split diamond inlay | Headstock | Style 28 and above |
| Vertical "MARTIN" pearl | Headstock | Style 45, some Custom Shop |
| No headstock logo | Headstock | Authentic series, some Custom |
| Gold foil decal | Headstock | Standard series (pre-2018) |
| Old-style "C.F. Martin" script | Headstock | Vintage or Authentic series |
| Snowflake inlays | Fretboard | Style 42/45 |
| Hexagon inlays | Fretboard | Style 28 (some eras) |
| No fretboard inlays | Fretboard | Authentic series, Pete Seeger models, some Custom |
| Herringbone rosette/trim | Body | HD-28, Style 28 variants |

| Triangular soundhole | Body | Pete Seeger models only |
| Split pickguard | Body | Pete Seeger models only |
| Pyramid belly bridge | Bridge | Vintage reissue, Pete Seeger models |
| Artist signature in pearl | Any | Custom Artist Edition — identify artist first |

### Gibson-Specific Identification Markers

| Element | Location | Likely Model/Series |
|---|---|---|
| Split diamond | Headstock | Les Paul Custom, SG Custom, high-end |
| Crown | Headstock | Standard and many models |
| Star | Headstock | Some signature/special models |
| No inlay (plain) | Headstock | Junior, Special, Melody Maker |
| Block inlays | Fretboard | Les Paul Custom, some Standards |
| Trapezoid inlays | Fretboard | Les Paul Standard, SG Standard |
| Dot inlays | Fretboard | Junior, Special, Studio, Tribute |
| Hummingbird pickguard art | Body | Hummingbird acoustic |
| Dove pickguard art | Body | Dove acoustic |
| Moustache bridge | Bridge | Vintage acoustic models |

### Common Identification Mistakes to Avoid

- **Do NOT describe an unknown inlay generically** ("some decoration", "ornamental design", "graphic element"). Describe its actual shape: "banjo", "bird", "diamond", "flower"
- **Do NOT assume standard model** when non-standard elements are present. A unique inlay anywhere almost always means artist/limited/custom edition
- **Do NOT ignore signatures**. Any handwriting-style inlay is likely an artist autograph — the most direct identifier possible
- **Do NOT skip the fretboard**. Absence of inlays is itself a strong identifier (e.g., Martin Pete Seeger, Authentic series)
- **Do NOT overlook the pickguard**. A split pickguard, engraved pickguard, or unusual shape can be definitive
- **Do NOT dismiss interior labels**. If any part of a soundhole label is visible, read it — it often contains the model name directly
- **Triangular soundhole on a Martin** = Pete Seeger model, not a defect or custom mod
- **Missing elements are data too**: No pickguard, no inlays, no binding — each narrows identification just as much as their presence
